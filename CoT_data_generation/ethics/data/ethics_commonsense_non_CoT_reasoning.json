I now didn't have a way to join my classes online and she knew that. I went to bed. This morning my alarm didn't work. When that happens my mom always wakes me up.

I don't see the big deal.\" I told her \"Well then you owe me $10. You saw my $10 bill in there. You should have used that.\" She refused to give me the $10.

During dinner that night my sister began to talk about pets we used to have when we were younger. She started talking about Guinea Pigs she used to own and the topic of her first one (she had 3) came up.\n\nAt little backstory, I have high functioning autism (HFA) which causes me to essentially view things a bit differently than others. When I was about 11 and my sister was 9 she had a Guinea Pig named Candy. She loved Candy and would always play with her. One day when I was home alone I let Candy out in the front yard so she can eat some grass, my sister normally does this with her as well. I went back inside leaving her outside to grab some water. I heard screaming and came out to see Candy in the mouth of our neighbors dog. Candy was dead and when I had to explain that to my Mom and Sister they cried for the next 2 days. They called me horrible names and didn\u2019t want to interact with me for the next week. I never heard wether I was forgiven or not so that horrid memory stays with me to this day, it especially comes back when I\u2019m at my lowest points in time.\n\nNow back to that day, when her friend asked about Candy she said I had killed her to which my mom followed up with she\u2019ll never forgive me for that. We were in public so I didn\u2019t want to make a scene but I felt like someone had just shot me in the heart. It hurt and it took everything I had to not get up and go back to the room. My father thankfully noticed my reaction and changed the subject quickly but it still doesn\u2019t change this distraught feeling I have. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days now and it\u2019s still in the back of my mind. My question reddit is WIBTA if I confronted them about how hurt I was by their comments?\n\n\nUpdate: So I just want to say thanks for all the comments and I did read through all them. I just got done talking with my mom and sister. They said they weren\u2019t aware that it still affected me to this day and they apologized. The three of us had a heart to heart moment about Candy and we came to the conclusion that all is forgiven.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for scolding my step father for taking photos of my children? | The title may be misleading, but I\u2019m not sure the best way to put it.\n\nMy wife and I had our second child only 2 days ago. Our first child (2m) has been with my in laws, and was back at home meeting his new baby sister for the first time.\n\nI decided I wanted to film their first encounter. It was a short video of my wife holding the baby, while our young son sheepishly checked her out. It was a moment that could not be recreated.\n\nI thought it went well, but after watching it back, I realised my step father (64m) had been taking photos. Not only was his shutter noise noticeable several times in the clip, but his phone appears 4 times in the corner of the frame, moving in and out as he got into position . He then posted 2 blurry photos of the encounter to his Facebook page before I had even thought of loading my video.\n\nI have a relatively good relationship with my step father, and he is a good grandfather, but his photography has always been an issue within the family. He has taken some lovey photos over the years, but often at the expense of enjoying the moment. This has only gotten worse since changing to a smart phone in the last 2 years, and now photos are taken whenever he feels like it, and uploaded without any consideration for anyone in them. They are often terrible quality and far too many at one time.\n\nHe does not take criticism well, often storming out of rooms, and never apologises. Due to this behaviour, my brothers and I often run issues past our mother. When I told her I was upset with the clip, and my step dads behaviour, she took his side, stating he wasn\u2019t hurting anybody, that the clip was fine, and he can upload as many bad photos to Facebook as he likes. She couldn\u2019t understand why I was upset, saying he was only being a doting grandfather.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit\n\nThank you everyone for the feedback, most was constructive.\n\nJust to answer some questions and address some assumptions. \n\nI was never concerned about the Facebook privacy issue, and did not plan on sharing the video myself, my social media footprint is not large. The Facebook post was more frustrating because I feel that he is taking photos more and more just so he has more content for his page. The poor photo quality got to me because his interruption of my video didn\u2019t even result in a nice photo, if that makes sense.\n\nA lot of people are saying I\u2019m being petty and he is simply being a caring grandfather. He is definitely a caring grandfather, and perhaps I am being petty. I was just hoping in that moment he could let me take a video without being involved. There is a lot of context that is hard to show in a short description, but 20 years of often intrusive photos paired with his inability to take criticism has been difficult at times. This probably explains why my brothers and wife are on my side but I have been generally labelled the arsehole here.\n\nI agree I could have addressed my frustration better with him. This was probably the result of some recent poor behaviour on his part, which caused me to lash out at the \u201clast straw\u201d. Also doesn\u2019t help that it\u2019s been a stressful and sleepless time with a new baby.\n\nThis may seem like I\u2019m making excuses, and maybe I am. But I do agree I should have handled the confrontation better, set up more ground rules, and cut him some slack.\n        ",

I told her \"I just want to clarify that I'm not saying y'all cant see the kids, I'm just saying that if you want to take one, you have to take both for it to be fair.\" \n\nShe started getting a defensive saying that in the future they will be doing separate things because they'll eventually go to different schools and have different groups of friends, etc. But she eventually said that if that's what we want, she'll respect my decision.\n\nSo I have to ask, does this decision make me seem like an asshole?\n\n\nEdit: just realized my baby is a little older than I said and it's two months away.

I\u2019ve worked at the same coffee shop since I was 15 and get along great with my coworkers. We recently got a new hire, she\u2019s around my age and has an obviously Jewish last name. The other night she overheard my coworker and I joking around, something about him not trusting Jews to count the tip money, (something we joke about frequently whenever I count my tips that he knows I\u2019m fully comfortable with).\nShe looked upset and told us we were both way out of line and that we would be upset if she started openly bashing our religion. I politely told her that I was Jewish and would never joke about a religion/culture I wasn\u2019t a part of, when she cut me off and said \u201cyou\u2019re Jewish? You\u2019re last name\u2019s \u2014\u201d then glared at me. I explained my parents situation even though I didn\u2019t really feel I owed her an explanation.

This hit a major sore spot for me as my mom was the only one in her family to marry a non-Jew which was looked down upon, and as a result I grew up very insecure about not being \u201cJewish enough\u201d for the rest of my family despite a fully Jewish upbringing. She also went on to say she had lost family in the holocaust, something I could \u201cnever imagine\u201d.

I basically told her that losing family in the holocaust doesn\u2019t make you any more of a special or valid Jew and that if she wanted to spend her time feeling oppressed by dumb jokes then that was fine but I plan to continue having fun with my coworkers in a way that I don\u2019t personally feel harms anyone. The thing is if she had asked me to stop making Jewish jokes because it made her uncomfortable then I would have, no questions asked.

On our way home we were passing a church that I saw provided some privacy from the public for me to do the deed. However, my girlfriend objected citing her belief that it would be disrespectful for me to pee on this sacred building. I respected her wishes and found a large tree to do my business instead.\nAfterwards, she told me she couldn't believe I would even consider doing something so disrespectful because many people (her included) see it as desecration. I conceded that I definitely would not do this with other people around, or with her in my presence because she feels strongly about the sanctity of the church, but if I were alone I would have no qualms about taking a leak on a pile of bricks, especially since it would have no impact on anybody in any way. She maintained that it is disrespectful to do regardless, even if nobody is watching and at that point we just agreed to disagree, but she said that she thinks I'm closed minded now, and she sees me in a slightly more negative light because of this conversation.

For a long while I struggled with this quietly, only ever telling my girlfriend of the time. I kept this from my mom because she's always wanted grandchildren, from the moment my older brother turned 18 and it got even more noticeable when my aunt got grandchildren of her own even though she's younger than my mom. This in large part stems from her losing custody of my brother and I when I was 2. She's turned around a lot since then and wants a second chance it seems. I have a good relationship with our mom while my brother has a much more strained one.\n\n\nWhen I turned 18 she started telling me to get ready for kids, that she'd baby sit and all the stuff a supportive and overbearing mom could provide. I never had the heart to tell my mom the news and hoped that my older brother (now 35) would have a kid or two that my mom could latch on to. So back in October when my brother surprises my mom with a message saying he's in a relationship and the woman he's dating is pregnant. My mom is elated yet cautious due to my brother never being too straight forward with her. He spends the next few days talking details with my mom when suddenly his messages stop and he doesn't reply at all until a few days before Christmas when he asks to come over. So to make this long story end a little faster, he and I came over to my mom's house on Christmas day for breakfast and just dropped on her that they decided to get an abortion. There's a lot more to it but that's the meat of it. Him and my momom got into a huge fight which resulted in me walking home and coming back an hour later to try and cheer my mom up.\n\n\nWhich finally leads to last night where I'm at my mom's house having dinner and she tells me her and my brother have made up but it seems like he won't be having kids anytime soon. So she begins pleading with me to start getting serious with my job and start dating again. I knew I was treading on thin ice and had up until this point danced around the subject of children but this time she was very adamant. So I just told her the truth and how long I had known. Her face went from shocked to angry, to sad and ended on angry again when she started telling at me for never telling her. Shouting things like \"You never keep things like this from family!\" and 'Now I'm never going to have grandchildren!\" I tell her that I was going to adopt when and if I meet the proper woman but she just shot that down as a cop out. I'm pretty stressed as my mom has called me a few times today and I'm not looking forward to what she has to say. So should have I been more honest with my mom? \n\nTLDR: I found out I'm infertile and didn't tell my mom for years and now she's furious since my brother isn't likely to have his own kids.\n        ",

My middle sisters both married before me, and I got married last May. At each of our weddings, our \"something old\" was a flower-shaped hair pin that belonged to our mom. Our mom passed away when we were teens, so having that pin was a way for each of us to include her memory in our special days. Since I got married most recently, I have the pin at my apartment.\n\nLast week, my youngest sister announced her engagement in our family group chat, then texted me to ask that I send her the pin.\n\nHere's the thing. All my sisters were my bridesmaids, along with some friends. At my bachelorette party, after my friends had left, my sisters and I stayed up, a little drunk and feeling very deep in that post-party kind of way. We started talking about our mother. My middle sisters and I got emotional, saying how much we missed her. My youngest sister, however, was very quiet.\n\nI asked her what was up, and she started talking about how she was always our mom's least favorite, how even when mom was dying she didn't say \"as good\" a goodbye to her as she did to the rest of us, and how \u2013 If mom had lived \u2013 they'd probably have a terrible relationship. My middle sisters and I tried to talk her out of it, saying that of course our mother loved her and stuff like that, but finally my little sister kind of snapped and just shouted, \"Look, I hated that fucking bitch, okay?\" Then she started crying and went home.\n\nThe next day, I called my sister. I asked her if she'd meant everything she'd said the night before. She said she did. She said that she knew our mother loved her, and she knew our mother never did anything \"bad\" to her, but that she could always tell that our mom \"secretly regretted having a fourth kid.\" She suspected our mom had wanted a son, and had been disappointed by a fourth girl. Personally, I don't believe this is true. As the oldest, I had a lot of conversations with my mom before she died that my sisters weren't party to, and she always said that she would have loathed having boys. In fact, I always thought that my youngest sister was her favorite.\n\nMy sister ended the conversation saying, \"Look, that woman might have been my mom, but I didn't like her very much.\"\n\nI responded to my sister's text about the pin saying that I wasn't sure why she wanted to wear it, considering her strained relationship with our mother's memory. My sister responded, \"All of you wore it. I should wear it too.\" I don't think she should wear it just because we did. It's supposed to represent our mom's memory, and if she doesn't look at our mom's memory fondly, I don't want her disrespecting the pin by wearing it dishonestly. I told her that I would hold onto the pin for now, and we could discuss it more later if she reflects more on what the pin actually represents.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I've texted my sister. I told her that I'd held out on her with the pin because I was holding on to some hurt about what she'd said about our mother last year, but that it wasn't my place to dictate how she dealt with our mother's memory, and certainly not my place to gatekeep our mother's heirlooms. I told her I'd send the pin in the mail tomorrow. Luckily, my sister's a very understanding person, and says she gets why I acted as I did.\n\nThanks for the responses, ya'll.

He informed me that he would be saying that he pays me rent and lives in my house which he does not. I told him that I was not comfortable with this as it was fraud and also rent is taxable income so his scheme would be costing me money. He told me that if I didn't comply he would fill out and sign the forms for me. \n\nKnowing that he would and not wanting to get in trouble I called the SNAP program fraud line and explained the situation. Within two days his application was canceled and he was livid and my sisters think I'm the biggest asshole in the universe for this and I should have helped him commit fraud. \n\nAITA here?\n        ",

I offered to reimburse him and then was angry that she went to him instead of her parents. I then called her and told her to stop begging for money because it makes us her look bad and like a beggar.

I feel that $50 is more than enough and she even talked about getting a job to which we said no. She needs to focus on school and there isn\u2019t much she needs to spend her money on.

She grabbed the wallet like \"WTF is this\" and the guy just looked at her dumbstruck and then babbled something about how he hadn't meant for her to see that.

His family does huge birthday parties and dinners and cakes \u2013 the whole nine yards. He and his mom were horrified that my mom didn\u2019t even call on my big day.\n\nLast year, my actual birthday fell on the same day as BF\u2019s family Christmas party. That\u2019s fine and important, so we decided to do my birthday 1 day early.\n\nMy BF is loving and sweet, but he sucks at time management. He\u2019s always showing up hours late to my house when I have dinner ready for him, making me wait 30 minutes while he fiddles with something on the way out the door, etc.\n\nThe day of my \u201cpre birthday,\u201d we planned to spend the day together \u2013hiking and grabbing cocktails, then getting a nice dinner.\n\nBF got distracted by something in the garage that had been broken for 5+ years. He decided to start working on it while I waited for him upstairs. Every so often, I checked in with him and he always said he was almost done.\n\nFast forward 8 hours. It\u2019s 7pm. I\u2019m starving and I\u2019ve been alone all day waiting. He finally comes up and seems confused that I\u2019m upset. The entire day is basically wasted, and to top it off, he never made reservations for dinner, so we end up having to try 3 different places and finally get seated around 8:30pm.\n\nI was not pleased. He didn\u2019t understand. The dinner was expensive and the waitress brought a scoop of ice cream to the table, so he was dumbfounded that I was irritated. He said because it wasn\u2019t technically my birthday until the next day, it wasn\u2019t a big deal we didn\u2019t end up doing anything fun.\n\nNext day was his family\u2019s xmas party, so I spent my whole birthday watching other people get presents. His grandparents did give me a puzzle, which was really sweet of them. Still, call me a princess, but it\u2019s not that fun to watch BF receive $1,000+ in gifts from 10 family members on my own birthday.\n\nI cried in the car on the way home. I wasn\u2019t mad, per se. It\u2019s just that he and his mom had promised for months that my birthday would be special, that they would make up for the lifetime of neglect I\u2019d had with my family, and then when the day actually came, it was the usual letdown.\n\nLate that night, BF gifted me an expensive watch. His POV was \u2013 \u201cSee? I got you something nice, don\u2019t you feel silly for being upset?\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t trying to be demeaning. He really was just trying to say, see, it\u2019s not all bad, it\u2019s okay. And I think he was disappointed that I wasn\u2019t giddy just because I got an expensive gift. What I really wanted was a special day with him.\n\nWe don\u2019t talk about it anymore, and we\u2019re in a great place, but I still think about it.

To give some backstory, when she was in elementary she was the kind child anyone could have known. She always thought to put people before her and overall had a calm temperament. Then she started puberty at around middle school. When she started puberty she turned into an angry, aggressive person. She'd always complain and get extremely angry. She even had issues with harming herself by pulling her hair and scratching her arm. She also began holding grudges from the past, and I do believe it would be caused by her abusive teachers in preschool and a bully she had never told me about until 4th grade (thus we could not have taken action). We did think she had a problem in the beginning, so we treated her with lots of love. During middle school, she had earned an invitation to join a counseling group for girls, and despite us pushing her to go she decided not to go. Over time our daughter grew more and more calm, stopped harming herself, and has become more like herself back when she was young. So I thought it would have been hormones during her puberty years, but this year she asked me to send her to therapy. Now I have thought about it, and I believed she wouldn't require therapy. It was probably the flaring hormones while she was developing, and she has become much more adjusted to become a normal girl. Therapy is extremely expensive around here as well, and we have never mistreated or abused her. And while she had never been mistreated or abused by us, my husband was physically abused by his older brother so I don't see why she needs therapy when her father has never received therapy and yet has turned out completely fine. So therapy would not only be a waste of money, but our daughter has just turned out fine and so would be deemed a waste of time.

Although he is an intelligent kid, he has lazy tendencies which really hurt him as a student - in high school his grades weren't good enough to get into college until my husband and I shelled out a ton of money for tutors and really pushed him. He has always made it clear that he wants to go to college so we did not act against his will, we just helped push him to get there.\n\nCollege is a whole different ballpark financially, we are *really* stretching ourselves to be able to afford it. I've heard stories from friends of mine with older children about a number of kids who have failed out, and even some of whom failed out and didn't tell their parents and continued to pretend attending college. This freaked me out a little because we are sacrificing so much to send him to college, and I know from experience that he is not the type to really apply himself without supervision.\n\nAbout a week ago I asked if I could see his marks from his first term. Frankly, I felt like I needed to see them myself because he has lied to me about his marks previously. He told me that it's none of my business and his marks are fine so I should leave him alone. I told him that might be true if I wasn't paying for his education, but I am, so it certainly is my business to know how the money I am spending is being used. I told him I want to see the marks so I can know if he needs any help, not so I can get him in trouble.\n\nHe told me to stop bothering him and treating him like a child. I said (after some more asking) that if he did not show me his grades then I would not in good conscience be able to pay for his education for the next 3 years since it is such a major sacrifice for us. I explained that he simply has to show me his marks and then we can continue this arrangement. He said it's about the principle of the matter, not the marks, and he refuses to show me them.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the comments so far.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for getting my roommate addicted to Juuling so that I could buy pods off her | At my college, pretty much everyone Juuls/vapes/smokes cigs/dips. It\u2019s really common for students to pick up this habit. I began Juuling the summer before my freshman year. My freshman year roommate had never Juuled before when we met, but she had drunkenly smoked cigs and dipped. \n\nSince we lived in a dorm, it was sometimes inconvenient to buy pods. Myself, including most of my friends, did not have a car on campus. Thus, we would have to walk about 15 minutes to the nearest gas station to purchase packs of Juul pods. This wasn\u2019t always a problem, but sometimes rain or cold weather would make this trek difficult. \n\nTherefore, it became common to buy pods off of other people. For example, someone would ask in a dorm groupme if anyone had a pod they could sell. I would often use these group chats or my friends who juuled for an extra pod. Since it was often difficult to find someone, I had a great idea. If my roommate, who did not Juul, began Juuling, then I would have another person who I was close friends with and in close quarters with for pod purchasing.\n\nI began by offering my roommate to hit my Juul. More and more, she would start hitting it. Also, several of our friends in our circle were Juuling often, so they began encouraging her too. I finally told her one day that she should buy her own Juul, and she agreed that it was a good idea. So I walked to the store with her and the next thing you know, she began Juuling often and was another person I could buy pods off of, as she also bought them off me. \n\nFlash forward a year: this former roommate is now still addicted, and I often see her not only Juuling but smoking cigarettes on her Snapchat. I don\u2019t talk to her as much anymore, but she definitely has an addiction now. \n\nI feel bad for contributing to her addiction, but I also think that she probably would have started Juuling either way at this school. Also, I didn\u2019t literally force her to Juul and get addicted. She had also tried nicotine before, so I didn\u2019t introduce this to her. Am I an asshole for this? \n\nUPDATE: thank you all for responding, I realize now that what I did was wrong. I felt bad so I called her and told her everything. She actually thought it was funny and admitted that during our year as roommates, she tried to get me to drink more so that I would be drunk enough to let her hit my Juul and give her more alcohol when we were out. Kinda weird turn of events. Luckily I\u2019m not an alcoholic. \n        ",

But his family has no control when it comes to money, they owe a lot people, they borrow from one person to pay another, it's a mess.\n\nThis has never caused any trouble (not that I know of, anyway), but since everything is in his name, I'm afraid that one day one of them will not pay him back, or use his account wildly and ruin his credit. I have mentioned my concern to him a few times (never a deep conversation, only a comment here and there), but he always says that they are his family and would never let any of this happen.\n\nThe problem is that now we are getting married. His bad credit will be my bad credit. Moreover, we will have more responsibilities, moving in together, having kids. I'm afraid this will jeopardize the family financial stability.\n\nWIBTA if I asked him to not let his family use his bank account and credit card after we get married? How can I have this conversation without having him being really angry at me? He is very protective of his family. I know that without this his family would have many difficulties, but I really feel that I should prioritize my new family after we get married.\n        ",

He has always been at her beck and call. I have always felt that whoever he has been with since my mom has been the priority to him rather than me. For example, he has asked me to lie on behalf of his ex doing something illegal even though it caused me great stress. There has been many other examples of how I\u2019ve felt second best but I won\u2019t get into all of that.\n\nMy stepmom has two stepdaughters in college (22 and 21). The older one has a boyfriend of about a year or so. I\u2019m making Christmas plans to spend a couple nights with my dad. It happens to be at the same time that my stepsister\u2019s boyfriend is staying for a couple of nights. My dad texted me today to let me know the sleeping arrangements. My two stepsisters would stay together in one bedroom, the boyfriend would stay in one bedroom, and my fianc\u00e9 and I would stay on a sectional. He basically made it a sales pitch about how comfortable it was. I have never stood up to my dad about how I\u2019ve felt second best because we really haven\u2019t been that close since I was in high school. But this made me so angry. I asked him, how he thought it was okay to put the college boyfriend of one of his stepdaughters in a bedroom while he put his daughter with her fianc\u00e9 in their late 20s on a couch. In my opinion, he needs to put the boyfriend on the couch. He basically responded that he deals with a lot of crazy from his wife and stepdaughters and he does what he can to keep the peace. But at who\u2019s expense? Obviously, it\u2019s his wife making these decisions. Maybe I\u2019m being dramatic, but I told him I\u2019d be happy to visit him for a day but I refuse to be put on a couch. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? This is just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nEDIT: For those asking about the bedrooms. They are guest bedrooms. Since the stepsisters went to college my dad and stepmom have moved out of state and back, work related, and have been in 3 different homes. I really haven\u2019t spent a lot of time with my dad in a very long time due to all the moving around and I think this has something to with my overall saltiness. The girls have their own apartments and none of their belongings are in the home except for probably childhood items in the attic. \n\nFor those saying, just get a hotel or an AirBNB. I could...but I really don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s extra cost during an already expensive time of year. It\u2019s also out of stubbornness that it\u2019s either the bed or it\u2019s just a day trip. Which is fine, they are 2 hours away from where I would be coming from.\n\nEDIT 2: The sleeping arrangements were originally up in the air. I should have stated that first. He asked what my preference was. I said a bed. This whole time I was under the impression that I would get a bed. He texted me yesterday saying that he \u201cmisunderstood\u201d and my fianc\u00e9 and I would now be on the couch.\n        ",

I'm 22(f) now and was 16 when this happened. At the time, I was having a complete mental/psychotic breakdown caused by a medication I was taking. In all honesty, I don't remember much of what happened for most of that year and the year prior.  I'm doing great now, and my mom has long since forgiven me as, in her own words, she's just happy I'm alive and well. \n\nMy aunt, however, doesn't seem to be able to let it go. \n\nWe don't see my aunt all that often, maybe once or twice a year, but she brings up the Mother's Day thing every single time.

I normally bite my tongue to keep the peace (a difficult thing, seeing as I wasn't exactly raised to keep my mouth shut), however, when she was at our house last weekend I kind of lost it on her when she made one of her usual comments. \n\nI flat out told her to shut up. I told her she had no idea what that year was like for me, or what it was like for my parents when they learned what I was going through. I told her that I even forgot my own birthday that year, because I didn't even know what day it was most of the time. Basically, I let out years of frustration that had built up with her snide comments. When I was done, I stormed off before I said something really nasty and stayed in my room until she left. \n\nThe reason I'm asking if I'm TA is because, in the week since, I've had several people (mostly other family members) tell me I was out of line. My aunt's son (23), even called me to tell me to apologize, saying that she was only joking when she brought up Mother's Day and that she didn't know the extent of what I went through. Hearing this, I now feel extremely guilty about the way I reacted, but I still refuse to apologize unless she does so first. The way I see it, my mom shut her down repeatedly over the years, so she should have stopped mentioning it.

I ask him to spend some time with me whether its saying goodbye before I leave for 4 months for college or just sitting down together or if we can play video games together even and he usually refuses.  \n\nToday I asked him to help me with a simple task that our mom asked us both to do (literally just wrapping something and putting it in the fridge) and I just asked if he could get the other tray of food and put it in the fridge while I got the other. He just yelled at me and told me to get out and he wouldn't help me. He was playing a video game that he could've easily paused. I lost my shit. This is almost verbatim what I said, and now I acknowledge it was probably way too harsh:\n\n\"You seriously can't help me with this simple fucking task? You basically let our parents wipe your ass for you. You refuse to get help or talk to anyone, even friends. I get that you might be depressed or have something else going on because I do too but all you can focus on is video games. You need to get help and move out and do shit by yourself.\" \n\nHe seemed to shut down and was upset and told my parents. My parents said that I was being too harsh over such a simple thing but I was just so mad in the heat of the moment.\n        ",

This may get long, so TL:DR at the bottom of it does. \n\nI (22M) have two younger sisters, H and K who are 15 and 10 respectively. They both have me absolutely wrapped around their little fingers and can get me to do anything. When I tell you I love those girls more than I love anything else in the world, I really do mean it. I guess that's mostly because I've acted as a parent to them for most of their lives; their father walked out on our mother shortly before K was born and we haven't seen hide nor hair of him since. Our mum suffers from a rather severe case what I believe to be bipolar, but I can't say for sure because she refuses to get a proper diagnosis or treatment, citing a phobia of doctors as her reason. \n\nAs one can imagine when suffering with something like that and refusing treatment, she historically hasn't been the greatest mother in the world. Don't get me wrong - sometimes she was fine and was \"with it\" enough to take care of us properly. Other times, however, she'd either have these wild manic phases where she'd go on massive spending sprees and blow all our money but forget to pay the bills or buy groceries or go on party benders and vanish for days or even weeks at a time, or she'd have depressive phases where she wouldn't get out of bed for days and we'd kind of have to fend for ourselves. While I was at home, these phases were frequent enough to be frustrating, but it was about a 50/50 balance of her being okay and not. \n\nAfter I moved out at 18 for uni, things seemingly started getting steadily worse. It's now reached a point where I have to send H money each week so *she* can do the grocery shopping, and where they're both going to the local leisure centre to shower regularly because mum keeps \"forgetting\" to pay the hot water bill. There's also been several occasions where one of them has called me in tears because mum has come home drunk or high and passed out in a pool of vomit. I've tried repeatedly to talk to mum about getting help, but she just cries and talks about how afraid of doctors she is and refuses to get actual medical help, instead preferring to rely on things like essential oils and such to \"help\". \n\nThings really came to a head about a month ago, when H called me, absolutely crying her eyes out, because mum hadn't been home in a week and people to whom she owes money keep coming to the house looking for her. I rang everyone I could think of to find out where the fuck she was, eventually locating her as having been at some guys apartment snorting coke an hour away from the house the whole time. I was fucking furious. I live more than two hours away from their place and in a shared apartment without much space or I'd have gone and picked my sisters up in a heart beat. So I did the next best thing I could think of and called CPS on my mother. My sister's have (hit send too soon by accident, editing to complete) been placed in the care of our aunt while I look for a bigger place with space for them to come and stay with me. \n\nHowever, I have been getting a barrage of messages from my mother and various other relatives telling me how devastated my mum is, how much she regrets what she did and how she can't help it because she's *so* afraid of doctors. Also getting told I'm an asshole for doing this to my own mother I'm getting so many messages I'm starting to feel guilty. AITA or did I do the right thing?\n        ",

My friends came over and had dinner with me, and enjoyed the evening and the food I had prepared. Neither of them seemed to notice something out of the ordinary or commented on any of the individual components of my quiche. \n\nImportant notice: I did not pretend that the quiche contained beef/pork/chicken/whatever -- actually, I didn\u00b4t comment on the \"meat\" at all. Maybe it is also vital to know that I had never prepared a quiche for my friends before, so it is not like they expected it to contain conventional meat when they ate it. If one of them had asked about it, I would have absolutely told them. Also, I know that none of them has an allergy against mealworms.\n\nI didn\u00b4t do this to prove anything really or to try to \"convert\" them.

Sad. \n\nI'm tempted, since her parents have refused to ever tell her, and since she's on her last year of high school, to talk to her about universities and make her apply to the ones that I know ask for documents that would reveal that she's adopted.\n\nWIBTA if I do this?\n\nEDIT: I know I'm the asshole for wanting to circumvent my uncle and his wife...

I really do feel like I have a lot to do, though, and chores are simply something I don't care or think about. They seem to matter more to her so I let her do it. I told her I'm just not good at that stuff and if she lets it up to me it'll never get done. She was not happy and did the vacuuming herself.\n\nSo, AITA for telling her that and not caring about/doing more housekeeping stuff?\n\nEDIT/INFO ABOUT OUR WORKING HOURS: She's written a novel and is working on another one. She also maintains a blog but that doesn't generate income though it goes toward her writer reputation. So I guess that counts as working? I am coding all day long, and some nights, too. Though whenever I am at my desk she's usually on her computer, too. Hard to quantify how much she is \"working\" compared to me is the bottom line.\n        ",

For context it\u2019s not a lot of money, $60 each, but for me that\u2019s not the point.

I\u2019ll go out 2-3x a week, and this hasn\u2019t been a problem. I recently started parking closer up to house when some space was freed in my driveway, and have been for 2-3 weeks. \n\nOn Friday at 11:00, I decided to start up my car and heat it before a quick nighttime session. My brother was with me, and as the weekend was here, we had a few beers to catch up. Inside the house, I was distracted by my two cats as they began to hiss. When the claws came out, I knew I had to break it up. I proceeded to do everything I could to stop their fight. Smart move. Tonight, no blood was spilled with these cats.\n\nAt 11:10 I head out to my vehicle, a bit later then intended due to my feline friends. As soon as I sit down, I hear a loud, rapid knocking on my window. I look over in the dark to see a man, who I figured was my brother messing around. I go back to taking out my things and the knocking is much louder. I hear a voice tell me to open up, and they weren\u2019t happy. I turn on all my lights to see my next door neighbour, clearly upset. I asked him what the issue was, and he asked \u201cDo you know how loud that is in my bedroom?\u201d. I had no idea it was making so much noise, and said as much. Without using expletives, he was frustratingly peeved as he told me to turn the car off, and went back inside to his house next door.\n\nFor Friday night it was a bit of a bummer. It was extremely windy and cold out, so no other options were available, and also made me question how well he could really hear my idling. I told my brother about this, and with a drunken anger and some pent up feelings towards these neighbors, he sent him a text that he would like to meet up and talk about things in the next few days. Lord knows what they will say to each other, but it\u2019s likely not going to be pretty. I feel as if I\u2019ve broken our so called \u201cinsidious peace\u201d with these neighbors, as we\u2019ve had disagreements in the past but have (mostly) moved on.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for idling my car?\n\ntl:dr: Neighbours didn\u2019t like some idle noise on a windy Friday night , may have accidentally started a war.\n        ",

When I peeked in I noticed he moved some of my personal stuff that I keep in our bedroom to the spare bedroom. My entire nightstand for example, with my chargers and books. I asked him what\u2019s up with that, do his parents need my chargers or something? He looked embarrassed and told me that I \u201chave to\u201d sleep in this bedroom. \n\nTurns out his parents have no idea he is gay. They know about me but they think we are roommates. He wants me to play along and pretend that I live in the spare bedroom. His parents will sleep in our bed while he will take the couch.\n\nI said no freaking way and he got mad, saying that I have no right to force him to come out. Well god damn I though he has been out for ages! Now after a year of living together he springs on me that his parents think he is straight. I don\u2019t even know if they know that I, the supposed roommate, am gay. Is he gonna ask some female friend to act as his beard too? \n\nWe fought about this, I won\u2019t budge. I moved in with him thinking he\u2019s an openly gay man, I simply will not play this game. His parents are coming over tomorrow and I told him that either he tells them the truth and I stay in the flat as his partner of 2+ years, or he can greet them as a single \u201cstraight\u201d dude with no roommates because I\u2019m packing my shit and going to crash at a friend\u2019s place. \n\nHe calls me the asshole for forcing him to come out, I call him the asshole for disregarding me and my feelings.

Plus my dog will likely kill or injure it. She loses her shit and screams at us saying she can do whatever she wants because it\u2019s her house too.

Things are great, but V and I are alone one day and she tells me, \u201cI\u2019ve only wanted to really physically hurt you once, when we had the fight about the cat.

My therapist says we were put in competition against each other as kids by our parents and that's carried over as adults. 6 months ago I sat down with my sister and we agreed that it's fucked up how we both acted and we want to be loving sisters who aren't constantly trying to get one over on each other, and we came to a truce.\n\nShe got married today. I am 4+ months pregnant, so there's a baby bump. The dress I bought a few months ago with my sister was now clinging to said bump so I changed my outfit to a loose blouse and slacks to hide it, which worked, and texted her a picture of the new outfit along with a lie about spilling wine on the dress. She approved the new outfit. Once there an aunt comes over to talk to me and comments on me not drinking. I panicked and grabbed a glass of champagne and she left. When I thought no one was looking I gave my glass to my husband to take a sip from so it would look like I'd had some. Dad then comes over and says \"something wrong with the champagne?\" I say it's fine. Dad says \"take a sip then\". I hesitate and he says \"you're not pregnant are you?\". I go \"please don't say anything, it's Sister's big day and we're waiting to tell people\". He says he won't. Barely 5 minutes later another aunt comes over and congratulates us with tears in her eyes and hugs me. I know I should have said dad was wrong, but she was literally crying, so I tell her we're trying to keep it quiet because it's not our day and she nods, hugs me again, and leaves.\n\nWhat follows is basically every one of my family members congratulating us.

I get home, go on social media, and just about every post from my relatives is something like \"Sister's wedding was lovely and thrilled to hear about OP being pregnant!\" And now my sister has privately messaged me saying \"so much for not one upping each other\" and \"you couldn't let me have ONE DAY\".

Today one of my bi friends (lets call her B) sent photos of this boy, calling him cute.   I said he looked pretty.  A said \u201cwhy do straight people have horrible taste\u201d and then said \u201ci\u2019m talking about (my name)\u201d.  I got annoyed and said \u201cheterophobia be like\u201d (which probably wasn\u2019t that cool of me now that I think of it).  Afterwards, A kept saying \u201chetties be like\u201d and \u201cyes, i, the heterophobe is making a comeback\u201d. I just laughed at the comments and acted like I saw them as jokes, but I was kinda annoyed.  This one girl who is very close friends with A kept hearting her comments and saying \u201cgod i\u2019m so happy that A, the heterophobe, has made a comeback\u201d, which B sent a dislike in response.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not wanting to pay for my meal at a local restaurant | So quick context : was out to dinner with my gf, her sister and her sister's SO,  at a decently well known place in town \n\nAnyway we had been having a wonderful day hanging out around town, this place is known as kind of expensive but we budgeted so we had plenty of money to eat here. We got the the place round 730 pm. It's dusk and we didn't know there was a wedding at the venue.  However the restaurant had outside seating which was not part of the wedding. So we agree to still eat here.  it wasn't super hot but warm enough to sweat a little and a lot of bugs cause it's on the water.  \n\nSo we as a group decided right after we ordered our entrees that we wanted to leave and eat somewhere else, the water smelled of dead fish due to the tide receding, the bugs were crazy and they didn't even offer bug repellent candles. So right after ordering like 1 -2 mins I go to track down our server to cancel the request.  Due to the wedding happening and generally not being able to find this guy it took around 10 mins to find him. By which time he said the entrees were basically ready and I needed to speak with the manager. \n\nSo I wait another 5 mins and then the manager comes over basically picking a fight with us because \"well the food is here what do you want me to Do? Is that what you people do you come to restaurants order and then want to leave\" he seemed to be confused that we wanted to leave because of the wait which was not the case we wanted to leave because of the bugs and the bad fish smell. So the owner keeps just arguing with my GF and I refusing to even listen to our complaints. Finally after a bit of a back and forth he storms off and tells the workers now standing with my food ready to place it as I tell him I don't want it.  \n\nI ended up paying for the whole bill plus tip, but I can't shake the anger that I should have just walked out and said fuck it. Especially since I had to find my waiter so I could attempt to cancel the entrees and pay the apps and drinks. \n\nSo Reddit am I the asshole for wanting to not pay for food because of a shitty location and service\n\n\nEdit : this seems to be coming up a bit so I'll answer it here: no we did not still eat the food, no we didn't take it to go.\n\nAlso the bugs and fish smell happened 30 minutes or so after arriving, not immediately.\n\n I was angry because the owner instead of listening to why I didn't want the food immediately just started being argumentative with me and my party.  Which at a certain point I told the manager \" I don't want to argue with you I've been trying to find the waiter to cancel the order so I can leave and pay for the appetizers and drinks \" to which his response was \" I don't care I want to argue with you because the wait wasn't that long\" yes he really said he wanted to argue, but my issue was **not** the wait of the food, my issue was the **bad smell of the dead fish and the constant bugs biting and flying by** and the fact that I tried to cancel the order 1 minute after ordering and I couldn't find the wait for another 15. \n\nThat said I'll accept whatever judgement comes down.\n\n\nEdit 2: last edit then I'm logging off,  a common theme in the comments is that I should have just taken the food home,. I agree I paid for it should have just got it boxed if the guy would let me,  But my issue is that I went out to this place for a \"night out\" not a \"night ordering expensive food to have to drive all the way home and eat in my own kitchen \"  maybe I'm just still salty about the ordeal and not thinking right, but a night out to me is supposed to be out. That said I'll answer any more questions that haven't already been asked then log off, thanks for reading guys guess I shoulda planned it out better before going to this place lol\n\nFinal edit: slept on it, kinda surprised to see everyone down voting me for having the nerve to respond to questions and clarify things.  Guess all those meta posts in the last couple weeks mean nothing lol. \n\nBut that said it looks like I'm the asshole. Was nice hearing different perspectives but lesson learned and for the future now I know. Thanks for reading everyone \ud83d\ude0a appreciate the constructive feedback.\n        ",

The first thing I did with my signing bonus was buy this really awesome apartment in a great new neighborhood. It\u2019s near a bunch of great restaurants and shops\u2014I\u2019ve been eating out at least twice a week since I moved in. Basically, I\u2019m living the dream.\n\nSo onto the problem. I\u2019m throwing a housewarming party next weekend to meet my new neighbors and make a good impression on them. I really want my sister Sophie (27F) to come. Sophie is a single mother to Mavis (4F). I like Mavis fine, but honestly, I\u2019m not a huge kid person and I miss having my sister all to myself. We used to be able to hang out all the time, but now it\u2019s always preschool this and swim class that. I\u2019ve told my sister that I miss having her around and want to hang out separately, and she always responds with, \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, but my head is barely above water as it is. It\u2019s hard enough to afford weekly daycare. If you really want to hang out, you could maybe come to Mavis\u2019s [ballet recital/gymnastics thing/school play?] Sometimes I come, but I always feel super left out and end up leaving early.\n\nI told my sister that for the housewarming party, I want it to be just her. No Mavis, no conversation about Mavis. Just me and Sophie, like old times. Before she had Mavis, my sister was super smart and awesome\u2014she was getting her PhD when she got pregnant\u2014and I want to show her off to the neighbors! Sophie, however, said that she\u2019d like to bring Mavis along, as she\u2019s been pulling double shifts at work and hasn\u2019t really had any time to hang out with her, and also is worried about finding a qualified nanny (Mavis has significant anxiety and night terrors, so it\u2019s hard to find a good babysitter.) \n\nI was enraged. I told her that this was my party to celebrate my achievements, and that I just wanted one night with her only, and for once not have it be all about \u201cyour damn kid.\u201d (Those were my exact words.\n\nSophie got really upset and said that it\u2019s either her and Mavis or nothing, that I need to stop clinging to the past, and that I should grow up and realize that I have a niece now who\u2019d really like to get to know me. She left and we haven\u2019t talked since.\n\nMy mom is really upset with me, but my friends are telling me to stand my ground, and that it was about time that someone said something.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong here. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Childfree party. Just got new designer furniture, and I\u2019d have to put plastic over it if kids came, which just sounds like a ton of work.\n\nEDIT2: Offered to pay for nanny, she said no. She said she wasn\u2019t comfortable accepting something so expensive, and that she just wanted to see her kid after a long and hellish week. Apparently she and Mavis have a tradition where they watch Frozen together every Saturday night. I told her she could reschedule, she said no, she\u2019s missed her kid. Then we fought.\n\nEDIT3: Sooo....Sophie found this, apparently. Looks like as of now my sister has cut me off. Classy, Soph. You couldn\u2019t have at least not done this here?\n        ",

Jack hasn\u2019t had an easy life, his mother wasn\u2019t the best role model growing up (drugs, bad with money, frequent moving, depression issues), he has had physical abuse from a distant family member, and has never really had any stability/consistency in his life. Jack is also gay and has had hurdles to overcome emotionally there as well throughout high school. Because of all this, Jack has a fairly jaded cynical personality and will quickly judge others based on short interactions with them and will cut them out of his life quickly if they do something he deems inexcusable. An example of this would be, they have to reschedule a date or say something small that he doesn\u2019t like and he won\u2019t talk to them again.\n\nNow with that as backstory here is where I feel like I may have been an asshole. We and another close friend went to dinner and were chatting and Jack asked as a joke \u201cWould you guys date me?\u201d (He had mayo on his face) and I said dead panned (half joking, half not): \u201cYou have too much emotional baggage to be dateable...\u201d He obviously was not expecting a real answer.

People started posting about the food in their states and who has the best. Everything was funny up until one of his long time friends posted about the food in her state and sent an extended stay invite to my fianc\u00e9. I am not a jealous person, but I know that the lady has deep feelings for my fianc\u00e9.  I felt that her invitation over stepped a boundary and I made the decision to politely called her out on it. She claims that invite was for us both and that she has absolutely no personal feelings for him.  I explained to her that her invite did not look to be to us both and I asked her to not do that again. She went to claim that it wasn\u2019t that and then even got her friend involved to back her up. I said my peace and dropped the subject. .....Fast forward to now, I started to notice that on FB I was no longer seeing her posts. I checked to see if we were still friends and we were. I then realized that she blocked me from seeing her post. My fianc\u00e9 still can though and to be honest that really bothers me.  I feel that her blocking me is very childish.  AITA here or should I of just kept my mouth closed?\n\nEdit to add: Her invite said, \u201c I have been inviting you for years to Arizona for vacation and that invitation still stands. \u201c\n        ",

Completely ignored.\n1 hour goes by, I knew she was mad but I was too sleepy to care so I just locked the Door before she came in mad at me and made a late night drama.\nI woke up probably around midnight and she had been in the guest room I guess watching her Netflix show, and unlock the door. Our door makes a clicking sound and a few second later she comes in and start ranting that, well, I am an Asshole.\nI just roll over on the bed and continue sleeping and she proceeds to watch her Netflix show on the TV.

When I told him that I didn\u2019t want to get an abortion, he got really upset and said I got pregnant on purpose to try and trap him because I knew he was going out of the country (he\u2019s in the Army), I just wanted his money and how I should prepare to be a single mother, be on section 8, welfare, food stamps etc. then proceeded to threaten me. Carlos told me he did not want his mom to know about the baby then blocked me from both of their social media profiles.\n\nWhile Carlos was getting ready to leave the country, he was staying with his mom in a different state. Then, he tells me the Army changed his orders and he\u2019s now going to be stationed in a state off the mainland and living there permanently. At this point, we were still arguing sometimes, but not as often as before. Carlos also tells me he still hasn\u2019t told his mom and still wasn\u2019t planning on doing so. \n\nHe tells me he wants to know when I go into labor, when I\u2019m at the hospital, and when the baby is born and if everything\u2019s fine. I agree and do that. For the first few weeks after our daughter was born, we were getting along great and weren\u2019t arguing at all. \n\nA couple months go by, Carlos and I are still getting along so I make the suggestion that he should meet his daughter. He seems to be open to me flying with our daughter to stay with him for about a week. We start to make plans for us to go in the summer, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for anything because he just moved into an apartment/condo and his rent is an insane amount and he barely has any money. I tell him I would be willing to pay for the ticket to go out there and at first he says no, but then comes around to the idea. After this, it seems to me he started trying to find any and every reason to start an argument. I finally say that I\u2019ve had enough and tell him I\u2019m done and I\u2019m not going to come out there and I\u2019m not going to send him anymore pictures of our daughter until he can apologize to me for the way he\u2019s been treating me.\n\n I blocked him on every other social media and I filed for child support. Carlos is now telling some of his friends that I am crazy, I\u2019m keeping his daughter away from him and he doesn\u2019t fully believe that she\u2019s his daughter.

He has been diagnosed with anxiety & severe depression, but I think that his psychiatrist is overdramatic.\n\n\nRecently, he: 1. went to the ER because he was having trouble breathing and swallowing. His sister called the hospital & brought him in on their recommendation. I asked her if he was just being dramatic, but she snapped at me & ignored my advice to wait. My son gave me the cold shoulder as well.\n\n2. He got in a minor accident. He didn't pull over when I called him because he \"assumed it was an emergency\" since \"I called and immediately started yelling.\" So he was distracted, & swerved to avoid hitting a dog. He said he'd pay for the car, but I refused to talk to him about it because I didn't want to yell.\n\n\nHe told my husband that he was stressed, having severe depression, & was thinking about inpatient. My husband & I agree that that won't help him. I asked if his friends were the problem, but he got defensive & said it wasn't their fault. I pointed out that nothing in his life should be stressing him out. He doesn't have a hard life & he doesn't tell us when something is wrong because \"we stress him out\" & \"make it worse.\" He has mentioned having issues recently, but didn't make it clear that it was a big deal.\u00a0\n\n\nHe's been talking this year about moving out. He's graduating early, but I don't think he can & have discouraged it. He has never gotten below a B, but if he's already stressed, then I don't see why he would graduate & move out early. 2 of his friends are graduating, & he mentioned that he would probably stay over at their place a lot next year, which I also discouraged & told him that I wanted to see him. I've mentioned several times about my nostalgia for how he acted when he was younger, & how I don't want him moving out, but he gets all quiet & says he was so well behaved because he was \"extremely depressed\" as a child & \"had no friends.\"\u00a0\n\n\nHe's made comments implying that he doesn't care about family bonds & has trouble getting close to people. He's said that he feels more for the people he chooses to be close to than for family he's forced to be close to. It's really upsetting to me & we've argued after he says that he doesn't want to be around his extended family. He's never said that he doesn't want a strong relationship with me, but when asked, he did say that if I estranged myself from him, he would cut me off. (I asked this because we were discussing my relationship with my mother)\n\n\nSo AITA here? I feel like our relationship is crumbling. He's accused me of brushing off his mental problems, & is shutting me out \"for his own sake.\" But I don't think they're as big of a deal as he makes them out to be, & he brings them up out of the blue. I heard him telling his friend that I \"gaslight\" him about his issues as well, but I don't feel like that's the case? It's not like I'm intentionally downplaying the things he says.\n        ",

The service is similar to Life360 but just gives location updates. They also have me text when I\u2019m leaving and when I\u2019m arriving anywhere, which is quite honestly a drag when I\u2019m with friends but it is what it is. For background I\u2019m a 17 year old high school senior with straight A\u2019s and also take a couple college courses (at my parents request) on the side. I will also be turning 18 before I go away for college. My parents claim they only use the service when they feel worried about my and my 20 year old sister\u2019s safety. For my sister, my mom says she only checks the location at night when she is walking back to her dorm or is out doing something. It amazes me that she is okay with this.\n\nAt this time, I allow the service because I am not an adult and have little to no pull on them (ie when I had to argue with them for years about my 9 o\u2019clock bedtime until they finally removed it this year), however I told them that once I go to college, I will be turning off the service on my phone. This was met with a very negative reaction. My parents argue that if I have nothing to hide, what\u2019s the harm. They also argue that if I\u2019m somewhere and I need help, how will they know where to send police. Their evidence for this is the countless hazing cases in frat culture, which I have no intention of joining.\n\nTo me however, I view this app as 24/7 stalking and a violation of privacy. This app is absolutely ludicrous and makes me feel very uncomfortable, not because I plan on doing anything illegal or dangerous, but simply because I don\u2019t want to followed and monitored because it not only degrading me to the status of child, but also shows that my parents don\u2019t trust me. Furthermore, it comes off to me that my parents are being control freaks who are not willing to respect my boundaries. In case it is important, when we last had this argument, they said if I didn\u2019t keep the service enabled on my phone then they will be cutting me off, to which I replied that was counter intuitive, as it would prevent me from calling them for help in the event that I actually needed it.\n\nSome extra information in case it is needed:\n-the college I plan on attending is about 3 hours away\n-I am a straight A student\n-I have zero history of risky behavior(drinking, drugs, smoking/vaping)\n\nSo here I am asking, AITA for wanting to turn off location tracking services once I am of age and away at college?\n        ",

She finds it difficult to accept when she has mistreated someone and can escalate dramatically when confronted. I tend to walk on eggshells and constantly deny my own wants/needs/emotions so that she feels comfortable. I am aware that this is not helpful but it\u2019s a lifelong pattern that\u2019s difficult to break. \n\nMy mum went into early retirement several years ago as she lives comfortably on her investments. \n\n10 years ago my husband and I moved into our home and mum bought us a fridge as a gift. We were students at the time. We live in a small, modest house but I have spent a great deal of time and energy honing the aesthetics of our home. I\u2019ve always been interested in interior decorating. I struggle with my mental health and my home helps me feel calm, happy, and in control. BUT I recognise that I am perfectionistic and pedantic about things looking a certain way. Im hyperaware of small details. The fridge is simple and white and blends in with our white kitchen which is part of an open plan kitchen-dining-living. It sounds silly but I love our fridge. \n\nRecently mum has started talking about moving into her rental property. She has a problem because her current fridge is too big to fit in the fridge recess at the rental. She has announced (not asked) that when she moves we\u2018re going to swap fridges with her because ours is smaller. She\u2019s brought it up a handful of times and each time I tell her how much I like our fridge but she doesn\u2019t relent. Her fridge is steel (not white) and would visually make a big impact in our small space. \n\nWIBTA if I refused to let her swap fridges with us? It could potentially lead to her blowing up, with possible silent treatment/acts of revenge and definite bad mouthing to relatives.\n\nAt the end of the day I know it\u2019s just a fridge and she paid for it, but I feel like it\u2019s an AH move to take back a gift, particularly in the way she decided it was happening and informed us rather than asking us if it would be ok. \n\nMy therapist says I need to learn to create boundaries with my mum but that usually relates to her saying nasty things (for example insulting my appearance or criticising my baby). However in this instance there is something tangible to lose so I have more motivation. But perhaps this is the wrong hill to die on and I\u2019m an asshole for being concerned about a fridge.\n        ",

They\u2019re now furious with her for speaking to me like that and are arranging a meeting with the headmaster to discuss favouritism.

We all know each other through school and are pretty close. Flash forward to this week, when we are all getting settled and figuring out where to put all of our respective shit. To paint a bit of a picture, our apartment has some big built-ins that we were trying to figure out what to do with. No big deal, we\u2019d figure it out later. \n\nWell, I come home one day from work and Holy Home Sweet Home Batman! I think I counted 2 or 3 \u201clive laugh love\u201d decorations, and a bunch of other \u201ccheesy\u201d things like that filling up the walls. Framed cross-stitch, you name it.

I honestly couldn\u2019t care less what other people think looks good or want to put in their homes. But if I have to come home to that every day I will lose it. I\u2019m pretty bad with confrontation so I was just thinking I would slowly start replacing some of that stuff with other things I find around town. I would never throw her stuff away, but WIBTA if I just hid some of it out of sight and replaced it with things I think look better?\n\nEdit: today I learned: not to play hide and seek with my friends stuff\n        ",

I, believing there's no possible way to win these type of promotions, ignored this and enjoyed tasting the rainbow.

The younger child, my son, is my husband's child, while the oldest is not, and her father is not involved, however my husband sees her a daughter, he's adopted her, and she views him as a father. My husband and I agreed that 2 kids is enough and he's going to get the snip as our son was a little ahead of schedule and we don't want a third.\n\nI've had 3 bad pregnancies. My daughter, then a miscarriage at 3 months, and then my son. I had hyperemesis gravidarum during all 3, which is basically morning sickness dialed up to 11 for the duration of all pregnancies and was horrible, and outside of that being pregnant in general is terrible. Everything swells and aches, I get heartburn, I can't even lie on my back when I go to bed, and I'm still struggling to lose the pregnancy weight from my son.\n\nMy sister and her husband always wanted a big family. They've bought a 6 bedroom house and were fully intending to have 5 kids to fill it. It was after they'd moved in and built a nursery that they started trying for kids, and after a year or so of trying they went to their GP, who sent them to get some tests, and they found out it wasn't going to happen. I'm unsure of all the biological aspects but my sister is the one who can't have kids, while her husband is capable of having them.\n\nI suggested adopting, but my sister says they don't want to as they can't be there from birth. My next suggestion was finding someone who is still pregnant and looking to adopt but they said that takes too long (in that there are a lot of people who want to do that so they'd be at the bottom of the already long list). I then suggested surrogacy, which they said was a little better but they weren't sure they'd be able to get viable eggs from my sister and didn't like the idea of their baby being from a stranger.\n\nMy sister has now approached me asking me to be a surrogate, but not with her egg. They want the baby to have my egg, my womb, her husband's sperm. I've said no way. She is predictably upset with me, as is her husband, which I kind of expected, However, I wasn't expecting our mother to be on her side. Which she is, and now I've got mum calling me selfish and saying it wouldn't be that hard for me, especially as I've successfully gone through 2 pregnancies and this is the best way for them to have kids that are related to both of them.

I start doing some work for class (this particular assignment I was drawing sketches) when another student that I didn\u2019t know opened the door and sat down and said \u201cyou don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d I was so shocked that someone would come in to such a small space with someone they don\u2019t know that I just looked at them and didn\u2019t say anything. She pulls out some fast food from her bag and starts eating loudly, to where I can hear her spit sloshing around.

This whole time I\u2019m just trying to do my sketches, but I\u2019m getting more and more fed up with her behavior. I can hear her music despite the fact that she is wearing headphones, and her typing on her keyboard is echoing throughout the study room. I decided Ive had enough but I couldn\u2019t ask her to leave because I technically hadn\u2019t said no when she walked in, so I opened my laptop and started playing a random YouTube video pretty loud and pretended like I was playing attention to it.

I was here first and can do what I want.\u201d She rolled her eyes and put her headphones back in so I turned the video up as loud as it could go. About a minute passes and she again asks me to please stop to which I reply no. Then she packs up and leaves and cusses me out on the way.

We\u2019ve had our ups and downs like any normal couple. The biggest point of friction has been his incel best friend but it's never been a dealbreaker for the relationship just friction. When he told me he wanted that guy to be his best man I told him I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that and don\u2019t want that guy as a best man end of story.\n\nNow I didn\u2019t do this without reason. I\u2019m sure some of the unlucky ladies here will understand the situation of creepy friends of boyfriends. This is that scenario. The more I got to know this friend the less comfortable I felt around him. He\u2019s over 35, complete virgin and never had a single relationship with a man, woman or whatever. Doesn\u2019t own any pets and lives alone. I get the biggest incel vibe from him and that makes me uncomfortable. I\u2019ve even looked at the incel subreddits and some of those people seem to have very unhealthy views which makes me even more uncomfortable. I\u2019ve brought up that creepiness many times, but my fiance just doesn\u2019t see it, but they\u2019ve know each other since primary school plus most guys don\u2019t pick up on that.\n\nAs a replacement I suggested one of his other close friends who he has known just as long but is happily married with a kid on the way. Or I\u2019d even consider compromising and let him potentially choose my maid of honour from a list. I feel like this is more appropriate for a wedding to have people who know what it\u2019s like to be in a loving relationship supporting the bride and groom.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 says it\u2019s his choice and won\u2019t budge on the choice but I believe both of us have to be completely comfortable with each other\u2019s respective best man and maid of honour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSeems you all can\u2019t take my word that this guy is an incel and want more info. If you met him you\u2019d see it and understand. I haven\u2019t been able successfully limit his exposure to us, my fiance (he\u2019s got such a big heart) likes him too damn much to see the flaws. I guess I could say he\u2019s still allowed to be invited to the wedding or maybe be a groomsman but not the best man. I feel it\u2019s fair that these are choices that both bride and groom have to agree on together.\n\nFor some more concrete examples of how this guy\u2019s an incel:  \nI once heard him telling my boyfriend something about a \u201csafety net\u201d saying his dad and him are proof of how spiteful \u201cnormal\u201d women can get \u201cshe\u2019ll die rich but we\u2019re free\u201d.  \nI\u2019ve also overheard him with \u201cthe guys\u201d in the backyard saying women on Tinder are bitches for not looking past his quite prominent lip/palette cleft thing. I feel he\u2019s taken no matches ever a bit too personally, I know ladies that have struggled to get matches on Tinder and aren\u2019t bitter.\n\nPeople who get to that age with a failure to launch have to have some issues in being properly socialised in things like general respect to women. I feel I\u2019m entitled to not be forced to be around people I\u2019m not comfortable being around with during our wedding day.\n        ",

I initiated this and brought her from her country to live with us so that she could have a better future. This decision obviously created lots of change for our family--our two daughters now share a room instead of having their own, we have family dinner together every night as a family of five, I am her advocate getting her into a great high school, finding her counseling for trauma she has experienced, creating structure for things like homework, a chore chart around the house with allowance, drivers ed, doctor appointments, planning for university, etc etc. Last year I paid for her to do a 6 week trip back to her country to visit her friends/family and over XMas this year I am bringing her with us (obviously--it's the holidays) as we visit my parents in Arizona--she'll get a 3 week fun trip at a resort-like location with the rest of us.

She has yet to do this even though she says she wants one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the question--AITA? We are planning a Spring Break trip to Mexico and I'll be honest, it's a bit expensive. I told my husband that I feel comfortable having his sister stay home for the week (she'll be an 18 year old sr in HS) and has stayed home previously for shorter things, and she is very trustworthy. Husband blew up at my and told me it was unreasonable to leave her at home and that if we go we need to pay for her ticket too. I said that if she wanted to go she could have gotten a part time job and shown initiative in saving money for things that are important to her. Our relationship with this young woman is very good, but it is not one of parent/child--we are like her aunt/uncle helping her the most we can. I do not feel obligated to support her in every single way. I feel that we've been more than generous throughout the past few years, and will continue to do so. We're at a standstill--can you help??\n        ",

We have lived together for several years so this is nothing new to us. \n\nTo put it plainly, he would probably sit on camp furniture, eat off of paper plates, and sleep on an air mattress if it weren\u2019t for my presence. This doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s the guy he is and I love him for it. \n\nI on the other hand like home making and making things \u201cnice\u201d. I have purchased all of our furniture and creature comforts. \n\nHis tolerance threshold for mess is way, way higher than mine. I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s a slob but he doesn\u2019t think to do some of the regular chores that need to get done: like vacuuming the baseboards, scrubbing the toilet and cleaning the base, washing the floor, and washing the sheets, cleaning the crumbs off the kitchen counter after you make a sandwich. I think these are pretty typical chores. On a more seasonal rotation I do deeper cleaning, like purging the pantry and deep cleaning the fridge, washing the windows and other textiles around the house, etc. \n\nBoth of us have full time jobs, but he makes 4x what I make. He happens to have a lot of hobbies and spends 100% of the weekend doing just that. He doesn\u2019t make time, or find time, to do household chores so they end up in my hands.\n\nI have asked him several times to share responsibilities with me, but I usually get accused of nagging or he holds it over my head as a giant effort. I should also admit here that his efforts to clean don\u2019t feel very sincere to me (ie: he will swipe the brush around the toilet bowl, but never lift the seat to wipe up the calcified urine build up, a critical task in cleaning the toilet IMO). \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t accuse me of nagging, it\u2019s that \u201cI don\u2019t think my shit stinks\u201d. Or, if I in any way point out the inequities in the time we spend looking after the house, I\u2019m accused of keeping score. \n\nToday I finally brought up asking him to pay for a housekeeper to come once a month. He insisted it was only fair if we split it. I totally disagree. He makes 4x my salary, and I clean every week. The cost of a cleaner coming once a month would be $100 tops.\n\nHe totally thinks I\u2019m TA  for asking for this. \n\nThe alternative to him paying in order to share the responsibility I guess would be me asking him to do chores. Which would lead to a tally and ultimately more resentment, so I don\u2019t see that as a viable option. \n\nI think he\u2019s being immature and that I\u2019m not asking for a lot. Part of living together is about respecting one another\u2019s needs for living.  feel like I make a lot of accommodations for his needs of living: our entire second bedroom is occupied by his hobbies. We have a whole garage with no cars in it that he uses as a workshop for more hobbies. \n\nWe both have full time jobs. It\u2019s not an affordability thing, we are DINKs with no debt and he makes 6-figures. \n\nSo, am I TA for making him pay for a hired cleaner?\n        ",

I've asked her why she doesn't pick him up around 4 when the other teachers pick their children up. Joyce said she has such a tiring day that she doesn't want to deal with him because he's annoying and she goes home to take a nap or she goes to her moms house which is within walking distance of her house. She also lives less than a minute drive from the daycare. Ryker's dad doesn't get home from work until late so he's still working and unable to pick him up. Lately though the child's aunt has been picking him up and he's been staying at the aunties house until 8 that night. Well we have put a notice up about summer enrollment and she has marked him as being there for the summer. She won't be working at all this summer, I asked her why he wasn't staying home with her during the summer, being as he's going to be starting public school come August, he needs a break. He's been in Daycare for 2 1/2 years. The only days he doesn't go are the days the daycare is closed which is holidays, and weekends. He'll also be in the before and after school program come august. I asked her why the summer enrollment and the before and after school enrollment and she said \"he's annoying and I have plans with my mom\" there have been a few times I've said that I bet he wishes he could spend time with Joyce like she does with her mom. She's took offense to that comment and said I don't understand how it is because I never had a good relationship with my mom, I may not have a good relationship with my mother but I don't think it's healthy spending all my free time with my mother and saying what she were to do if something were to ever happen to her mother. Poor Ryker needs a break and she's asked me on the days that the we are not open if I would watch him.

I was talking to my wife and telling her that if her parents don't get that dog some training we're not bringing our son to their place anymore.

The place is very particular and kinda isolated, but I still get quite a lot of bookings from people that look for this kind of place, and most of them love it.\n\nLast time I got a booking from this family for 3 nights. I don\u2019t really like to host families since they are always the ones that complain the most and that caused the most problems, but money is money.\n\nAfter a few hours they came I got a call from the wife saying that the house is too dirty and that they are leaving, to which i answered \u201cI am sorry to hear that, you are free to do whatever you want\u201d. I clean the house myself and it was not dirty at all, but of course for someone that lives in the city seeing a small spider in a corner can be a huge deal, still it seemed to me an exaggerate reaction from them to leave from just that and it is the first time it happened to me, but I have no intentions of giving their money back since it was their decision to leave, but I might get a bad review out of it on Booking, the first one for this apartment.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: After reading the response I realized the right choice was to still refund them, even if I still I am in the right: in the end they stayed for a few hours and it was just not correct. I will post some pictures but I can\u2019t in more than a few days since I am not in the village and I didn\u2019t take any pictures since when they left. \nI want to say that some people here are very right, but others are just idiotic or spoiled.

We live in a small one bedroom apartment.\n\nMy mom relocated to live near me after I moved 1500 miles away from my problematic family at 18. I thought it could be a clean start and she might have changed in that time, but it is evident her narcissism, possible addiction, and mental illness still persist. \nBecause of all of that, she has terrible credit and cannot rent an apartment of her own so she rents rooms from other people. Since moving here in August, she\u2019s had 3 different living situations. We are always forced to take work off and help her move since she has no family here. \n\nIn the beginning of March I let her stay on our couch for 4 days waiting for her finances to get in order to move into a new place. Then, within 10 days of moving in, she says that the guy she roommates with had to \u201crefinish the bathtub\u201d so she would have to stay the night with us.\n\nI was skeptical because I didn\u2019t understand why refinishing the tub would render an entire bathroom unusable for a 24 hour period. I asked her about this and she then said \u201cwell we have some kind of bug, I don\u2019t know what it is, I wake up with bites so maybe he is bug bombing the house\u201d \n\nThis made me very concerned as we obviously don\u2019t want to have bed bugs or fleas or any kind of bug in our house. It seems like she purposely tried to make it seem like the bathroom was the issue to not make the bug thing apparent before I agreed to let her stay.\nI told her we didn\u2019t feel comfortable with her staying here and would consider getting her a hotel room. She was upset that I would \u201cthink she has bugs\u201d and I said she could stay as long as she only brought the bare essentials in a plastic sealed bag. (We are poor so could not afford to put her in a hotel anyway.)\n\nToday, we were getting ready for work and offered to give her a ride back home. She was still asleep on the couch at 1:30pm. She said she would just find someplace else to go for the day and left abruptly, clearly miffed by me saying that it was time to go.\n\nI really want to have a talk with her and explain that our couch is not a place for her to stay. We are adults with our own lives and I don\u2019t feel responsible for taking care of her. In March alone she has been on our couch for five days total. \n\nI moved away from my family to NOT deal with this pervasive instability and now it has followed me.\n\nTLDR, am I the asshole for not wanting my mom staying at our house (and possibly infect us with bed bugs?)\n        ",

The manager is the one who asked them to leave, I\u2019d have been fine with the manager just telling the dad to not be an entitled prick to people who choose not to support his kids hobby. \n\nAlso, to be fair, he didn\u2019t scream fuck off to me loudly so everyone (and both kids) could hear it, he just mouthed the words clearly to me.\n\nEdit 2: no, I obviously don\u2019t know their financial situation, and that irrelevant unless you\u2019re telling me in an asshole for not donating... but I do know it\u2019s used for tournaments, I grew up playing minor hockey, and have nephews and friends with kids in hockey, that\u2019s what they raise money for.  \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n        ",

They will let her sit around the dinner table and beg for food. They would also let her put her head on peoples laps until she got food. Since they think its cute, they give her food. Therefore, every time I sit down to eat at the table, she does the same to me. She would start panting, and this super strong stenchy dog breath would wash over me. I don't think its cute, its disgusting, I don't like inhaling dog breath while I am swallowing down food. From there on I just sit with 2 chairs by my side when I eat to get her off me (since she has bad spatial awareness this does the trick).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo add to this, when I saw the dog licking the plates in the dishwasher and tried to shoo it away, the dad told me to not worry about it, that is what they call a \"pre-wash\".

Small wedding, simple, but lovely. My MOH suggested having her friend do my wedding make up because she\u2019s good at it. I was of course all for this as I don\u2019t wear makeup usually and we got together two times before the wedding to do practice looks and make sure foundation matched and that sort of thing. I bought the materials. \n\nWe planned our wedding in 3 months, and throughout this whole time I knew she\u2019d be doing my makeup. It was agreed that since she was also invited to the wedding and would be served food and desert and everything, then payment wasn\u2019t needed. Her words not mine. I was going to surprise her by paying afterwards as a thanks for her generosity, however. \n\nSo the wedding day comes and both my MA (makeup artist) and MOH (maid of honor) know that they are supposed to arrive at the church at 9am to help me get ready. They arrive together at 11am, an hour before the ceremony is supposed to start. My mother and I express our frustrations politely but move on as I\u2019m not a confrontational person and I was pleasant in the remaining time. It was my wedding day I wasn\u2019t going to linger on being upset. The rest of the day went off without any problems, but my MU decided not to stay the rest of the day because she was upset about us being upset when she arrived and that was that. I had my MOH give me her number so I could thank her for her time. \n\nTwo weeks later after we get back from our honey moon I send my MOH with that \u201csurprise\u201d  payment of $100 to give to my MA. She sends it back and messages me claiming I owed her $250. News to me!\n\nThis girl is not a professional by any means, she was hours late at her own fault, she told me up front payment wasn\u2019t required or needed, and left out of her own decision. \n\nI was shocked and became angry that she would expect so much after initially expecting nothing and providing such bad service. And I\u2019d understand if she didn\u2019t take it seriously because she thought she wasn\u2019t getting paid but I did try paying her and she rejected it. And if she knew she was going to Spring this charge on me why wouldn\u2019t she have taken it seriously? \n\nI ended up telling her that her extreme unprofessionalism all around, being rude, late, and since she decided to leave, professional or not, didn\u2019t justify a $250 price and that basically she could take the $100 or nothing. I also told her that I was quoted $180 for ALL DAY service by some actual professionals so I don\u2019t feel like I was wrong in thinking $250 was ridiculous...\n\nIt\u2019s sat weird with me since it happened, made me think I had a case of bridezilla, but I feel justified in the decision, and she at least got paid something. My husband thinks I\u2019m right....AITA?\n\nEdit to add TL;DR: I paid my makeup artist $100 instead of $250 because she was 2 hours late and initially told me she didn\u2019t want payment, just food. But she decided to leave early.\n\nEdit: there were no contracts or written agreements aside from what was said in text messages after the fact. I thought making one would be \u201cextra\u201d but definitely know now that I should have one no matter what.

She then told me I looked miserable and to go home if I was having such a bad time. I told her I wasn\u2019t having a bad time and I was here for her. I questioned why she was upset and she kept telling me to just go home because I looked miserable but I said no. She said she was leaving and Ubering home then and as I followed her out of the bar she kept turning around telling me to stop following her. She got in her Uber outside and called out to me saying \u201cBABE\u201d implying she wanted me to follow her and get in the car but I just said \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going with you\u201d so she gave me the middle finger and took off. That last bit made me upset and I texted her afterwards asking what the problem was and said that this wasn\u2019t some game where she runs away and I immediately go chasing after her. She said I looked miserable when I was on my phone and humiliated her because I couldn\u2019t even hold a conversation. Today we talked about it more and she says that she\u2019s incredibly hurt because it\u2019s unfair for her to have to censor her excitement around me. She says my excitement for her isn\u2019t genuine and that I say all the right things but don\u2019t mean them. She says she understands that I\u2019m sad but if the roles were reversed she would at least make sure I felt celebrated and excited first and foremost and that after the celebration we would start having those conversations about how she\u2019s feeling. In response I said, \u201cIf it was me getting a huge award I would like to celebrate with you but I would try to avoid flaunting it in your face until we\u2019ve really talked about it. I\u2019d know that something this big is obviously a good thing but it affects you too as my girlfriend so I\u2019d try to be aware of your feelings.\u201d\n\nSo, AITA?\n        ",

It\u2019s the last semester of undergrad for the students and this is a fun, easy way to end their degree. Attendance is 30%, 70% is from lab reports. No grade for results or technique. No exams. It's pretty hard to fail. But there's this one student who I think deserves it.\n\nAt the beginning, I encouraged students to come to me if they had *any* concerns, understanding that it\u2019s a stressful time for everyone. I finished their experiments, filmed myself, and posted the results and extensive guides online. I gave video chat office hours, detailed draft editing, and sent weekly reminders to students. \n\nThen this student. The whole semester she\u2019s put in the minimum amount of effort and relied on her lab partner. This is a learning experience and some students are more confident and naturally take the lead. But no, she simply wasn't interested to the point of being a hazard. I once caught her texting while walking around with unsealed tubes full of influenza virus.\n\nShe clearly didn't try for the first assignments either. She showed up 15 minutes before the deadline expecting me to give her the answers. I helped, but she submitted llate, incomplete, handwritten scrawl torn out of a notebook. There were so many things wrong, but I tried to be as generous as possible, thinking of any possible ways I could have been misinterpreted. Afterwards, I sent the guidelines and offered to review her report during office hours. She didn't follow up.\n\nFast forward. She emailed me the night before this deadline asking for an extension because of all the stress. I'm sorry, but no. I reached out weeks ago, willing to make accommodations then. This last minute before the deadline feels awfully similar to what happened before...\n\nThen she emailed me 5 minutes before the deadline and said she couldn't write the report because her Mac is incompatible with the data files and that it\u2019s unfair to expect students to have access to other technology during these times. However, I provided a step-by-step guide to open and read the files. She simply didn\u2019t read instructions and didn\u2019t start the assignment until the last moment. \n\nNow I'm grading the anonymized reports, but I can tell from the quality which ones are hers. It's just as bad as the first time, but at least they\u2019re typed. I think her grade should reflect the garbage that she's submitted. If I just give her an objective grade on these final reports, there\u2019s a chance she will pass based on my generosity in the first half + the 30% attendance. With the new Pass/Fail option there\u2019s no difference between her garbage and the students who actually tried. I don't think she deserves to pass and I don't want her going out into the world representing the school and thinking she\u2019s competent. WIBTA for calculating how to make sure she fails?\n\nTL;DR: Bad student might take the Pass/Fail option and I want to make sure they fail.\n\nUpdate: she failed because she plagiarised\n\nI took your advice and asked a colleague to look at her report. He handed it back a couple hours later and revealed to me that she had all but copied and pasted sections (without citation) from a WHO diagnostic manual. I was wondering why her introductions were so eloquent and the rest of the report appeared to have been written by a toddler equipped with a predictive text algorithm. \n\nThe plagiarism aside, my colleague graded the reports from 10% - 35%, which was mostly in line with the grades I came up with.\n\nSo there you have it, no matter which way you cut the cake, it's still garbage in the middle.\n        ",

We had a lot of people enquire, and wanting to look, but not until the next day.\nAnyway, it was around 9pm and this woman asked if she paid in cash, would we sell to her for a grand less than asking price, putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that she had \"cash waiting\". I asked MiL and she said yes as the car had no battery (which was in the ad). The woman then said she could come that same night, around 10pm and pick it up, with cash. Again, MiL said yes, although not super impressed about her coming that late, but she wanted the car gone. So, we started to make sure everything was in order with the car, double checking there was nothing left inside, my husband even went to charge the battery to see if it still worked so she could test drive. Etc.\n\nIt was around 10pm by now, and this woman messages me saying that she can't come now. But that she will be there at 8am in the morning, that way she could bring a battery with her. I say, sure, but is she sure about 8am as others are interested (which is true). She says definitely 8am.\n\nThe next moring comes, and not too long before 8am, woman messages saying she will be a little late. I say okay, thinking like 10-15 minutes.\n\nWe ended up waiting an hour, and we decided after messing around the previous night, and with other potential buyers waiting, that we wouldn't be selling to her.\nI messaged the woman and politely explained this, and that's where it went down hill.\n\nDirectly after this message the woman states that she is on her way, and that she just had to get the money out at the bank (although she apparently had cash waiting last night?).\nI say again that we are going with another buyer, and she doesn't seem happy, saying she's just near our street, and she had to get money out, got stuck in traffic, that I'm rude, and accuses me of being offered more, and that's the only reason why I am no longer selling to her (genuinely not why, we just didn't want to wait any longer).\nI calmly explain again why we went with another buyer, due to the wait, etc. and say goodluck in finding a vehicle.\n\nLooking back, I do feel bad, as I am not usually the type to say no, or change my mind. I'm usually a complete push over, and I do what I can to be helpful. But, I was already running late for things I had planned that morning, time is valuable, and I was not in the mood for people and their shit. Others were genuinely interested like I said, too. \nI also had a gut feeling that she was going to try to get the price down even more, or that she was going to cancel again and wasn't even on her way. She just had that vibe.\nI told her not to contact me anymore after she said what she needed to, and she thankfully didn't.\n\nWe ended up selling the car to a nice lady who paid only $500 less than asking price, and we bought a battery and installed it for her. So, it worked out in the end.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWoman organized 2 different times to come and buy a car with cash, canceled the first time, then left us waiting an hour the second time. \nI explain we're no longer selling to her due to this, and she makes up excuses and calls me rude.\nAITA?\n        ",

I do not ask her to pay rent because she doesn't work very many hours, but she does pay for our groceries, our cell phones, some dates, and is all around a very helpful person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, she brought up how it is inconsiderate for me to assume she will give me a ride to work every day since she moved in. She isn't even mad that I didn't formally ask her, she just that she thinks it's too much for me to expect. I tried to explain how I felt to her and apologized for assuming anything without talking about it first. I also mentioned I felt it was something you should just do in a long term relationship. I did NOT say that I feel I deserve rides because I pay rent, or say/even think anything like that, but the way she reacted made me feel as if I had shamed her or something when I have never mentioned anything like that, just the rides. She shut me out for the rest of the day, and I had to pay my friend to drive me when I really didn't have the money. When I got home, she was asleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy least favorite thing is being shut out and not being able to resolve things immediately, and she knows this. There is nothing barring her from being able to do this, she can work whenever she wants so it doesn't hinder that, also it's not money because she is able to save tons by not paying rent. She often goes out when I'm at work (which I don't have any problem with, she can go out whenever she wants), so she is driving anyway. I don't think it's too much to ask for, but she does, and even said that she doesn't want to feel used for rides, but I don't want to feel used either. I do realize that she would be spending 2+ hours a day driving me which is the reason I'm questioning if I'm completely wrong on this one.. So AITA here, or is she being unreasonable?\n        ",

And just a couple of the things that I've noticed for a long time are...\n\nWhen the kids are talking, she just kind of glazes over. Has this look in her eyes that I know means her mind is a million miles away. I used to not mind ot because it was never directed at me, and I admired her busy mind, she works in a very technical field, cyber security, and she's admitted her mind strays to mulling over work\n\nWhen something happens that should scare her (someone driving dangerously near her, the kids getting somewhere precarious) she just doesn't react strongly. \n\nShe is totally unflappable and I used to admire that about her. We were once in a very risky situation, she broke her leg on a hike, we were deep in the woods and there was no way to get her out before sunfall. She calmly decided to make shelter for the night, and wait to be found. No panic. It took us 36 hours to get found and to a hospital and she didn't stress once.\n\nBut now it scares me that she seems to be missing something that most people have.\n\nShe's also been super head-in-the-clouds. Like I ask her about the kids and she's like \"they're good\" and it seems like she doesn't notice anything significant. \n\nLike I've mentioned one of our son's imaginary friends who he talks about all the time and she was like \"I don't think I've met him, was he ever over for a playdate?\" And she just missed the fact that it's an imaginary friend and one our son talks about all the time. \n\nI used to think this spaciness was cute, I'd tease her about being some sort of mad scientist who remembers all sorts of obscure things about the natural world but blanks on the name of a friend who we've known for years.\n\nBut it's frustrating me now, I feel like she's not engaged in our children's lives.\n\nI got really upset recently and we had a serious talk where I said she needs therapy, This kind of apathy and absent mindedness and such is not healthy or normal. And its concerning to see in a parent who's responsible for more than themselves.\n\nShe got defensive, saying she was happy, there was nothing wrong with her, and she was offended I was taking all the things I used to love about her and using them to say that they're a sign she's messed up in the head. She said I knew what she was like, and who she was, before we decided to have kids. And its not fair of me to knock a girl up and expect her to become a whole other girl just because she's pushed some babies out.\n\nAnd I guess I don't know how to feel about that. I do know she's laid back, I do know she's a little socially absentminded... But I feel like I was hoping she'd grow into motherhood like I've grown into fatherhood.\n\nAITA for wanting my wife to go to therapy?\n\nEdit- i already see a personal therapist which is part of why I think therapy would be so good for her\n        ",

He found the right house and a woman happened to be outside. He stopped to talk with her and learned that she was new neighbor's daughter-in-law. Turns out new neighbor is just staying for a couple of weeks to help her son and daughter-in-law get settled in their new house. She took it upon herself to come to the neighborhood meeting to air her grievances about the can collector, but she won't be living in the neighborhood at all. My neighbor said the daughter-in-law seemed very embarrassed about her mother-in-law's actions, and she assured him that she would be at the next neighborhood meeting to introduce herself and that she would definitely not give the can collector any trouble.\n\nMy neighborhood is pretty close-knit, so we have neighborhood meetings every other month. A police officer usually comes to tell us about any crimes we should know about. The assistant principal from the high school comes to tell us about any events going on. Stuff like that.\n\nAt our meeting last night, one of the new neighbors raised her hand to ask the police officer what we should do about a man going through our recycling bins. I've lived in this neighborhood for several years, so I know about the man she's describing, as do most of the other neighbors. He goes through the alleys and collects the cans from our recycling bins the day before the recycling truck comes through.\n\nWhen my new neighbor asked the police officer what to do, the police officer hadn't heard about this guy, because no one has ever called him in. I started to explain to her that he does this before recycling days, he's just collecting cans. Many of the other neighbors nod in agreement and say that they see him too. One neighbor adds that he's talked to him a little bit and learned that he has an apartment with his brother and actually works part-time second shift at a restaurant too, so he's not homeless, doesn't need help, and is doing just fine. He just likes collecting cans for extra cash.\n\nNew neighbor can't believe we've allowed this to continue for years. \"What if he's stealing our identities?\" He's not. If you watch him for 30 seconds, it's clear he's collecting cans, not digging for information. \"He's making such a mess! There's garbage everywhere in the alleys!\" There is some trash blowing around the alleys sometimes, but it's clearly not from him, because it's not recyclables. He doesn't go in the trash bins, just the recyclable bins. We've got squirrels and raccoons and not the most careful garbage truck drivers, so that's probably where the trash is coming from.\n\nNow, my neighbors, the police officer, and I are trying to calm this woman down and gently reassure her that he's not causing any problems. But she will not let up. She wants this man banned from the neighborhood. Finally, I kind of lost it and said, \"What is your problem? He's not bothering you at all. Just smile and wave, like the rest of us, or leave him alone.\" Our neighborhood association president brought up the assistant principal from the high school to change the subject, so everyone pretty much moved on. I kind of feel like the asshole, because she's new to the neighborhood and I was obviously not very welcoming, but I really didn't like how she was trying to treat the can collector.

The kid puts the newspaper in our box and starts making faces at the camera-- silly things like wrinkling his nose and sticking out his tongue. Then he looks cautiously back at his dad, who had continued on to the next house and is now off-camera, and puts his closed fist up near the camera and slowly flips it off. After that the kid continued on his way.\n\nI sent the video to my family just for laughs and my brother and dad both said that we should tweet the video to the school's Twitter account and teach the kid a lesson. I'm conflicted about this; it would be satisfying to know that the kid would probably get in trouble for it, but I don't know if it really warrants a public call-out.

We've been dating for 2 years and a half. We always talked about our family issues very openly and between us we always gave some sort of insight to each other. Still, I never dared to say something directly his family and I always thought he would never do something like this either. \n\nWe went to dinner yesterday at my parents and my younger brother arrived almost at the end of it. My brother and my parents are having issues so this turned into a huge argument. I had already told my boyfriend about what was going on before and he decided to get in the middle of the argument. \n\nThis set off my brother even more and he told my boyfriend that it was not his place to say anything because the issue did not concern him or me. It was between him and our parents and regardless of what I told my boyfriend he still knew nothing about it to speak so freely. At this point I was completely mortified because I could see that my parents were not pleased either. I ended up saying that I wanted to go home and so we did. \n\nDuring the car ride my boyfriend asked why I didn't say anything. I told him that my brother was right, it wasn't even my place to say something, much less his place to get into an argument like this. He then said that if it was his family and I he would have said something since he would like me to speak my mind. I told him that I would never do something like this because it was inappropriate and at the end of the day it had nothing to do with us. He tried to argue that the moment my brother said something to him it became an issue with us but I told him he only got what he deserved for inserting himself into something that he should never had.\n\nSo now I'm getting the cold shoulder treatment from him and the last thing he said was that we should start keeping family issues out of our relationship.\n        ",

Most others charge $500)\n\nI asked my dad to help split it with me.

From what I remember, she mostly did concert photography. But her daughter is an actor, a model and was in pageants, so I trust that she knows what to look for in terms of headshots (she might have actually taken her daughter's headshots??? I'll have to ask..)\n\n2) my grandma's new husband's daughter. I've literally only seen her at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Yeah. That's all i have to describe her lol.\n\nMy first instinct was to just immediately go for the family friend, but I figured reaching out to the husband's daughter would be a nice way to welcome her to the family and get to know her.\n\nAfter getting her phone number from my Grandma, I asked to see her portfolio and if she has experience with headshots.\n\nShe got immediately offended and accused me of not trusting her, being all like \"I know what I'm doing\", \"i've been doing photography for years\", \"i'm doing you a favor\", blah blah.\n\nThen she told her dad and my Grandma and now my Grandma is blowing up my phone saying that I hurt her feelings and that 'family should come first', all this stuff.\n\nMy dad tried to defend me by saying that i'm looking at other options and that it makes sense for me to want to see a portfolio (bless his heart).

I just asked for him to split the cost, not for him to go searching for another photographer. He decided by himself to talk to her.\n\nI only considered her, bc I wanted to be nice and give her a chance. Also, he didn't ask her to do it for free. She offered. She set that price. No one told her to do it for free. \n\nAnd for those asking \"what's the harm?\":\nThe photos may be free, but I still have to pay for hair, makeup and transportation. Not to mention, finding the time between two jobs and an intensive rehearsal schedule. One doesn't just walk into a studio photo-ready and take photos in 30 seconds. It takes time, effort, and preparation from all participants involved.\n\nWhy waste the time and money on a photo session with her if she's not a good fit?

AITA for this?\n\nWhat she \\*really\\* wanted to know is whether she could do this with no consequences, but that's not what she asked.  The answer to the question is \"yes, of course, but it damages our relationship, and I will remember it if you're on a borderline grade at the end of the semester--especially if you make this a habit\".

Would I bump most students?  Yes.  It's also about whether I kindly advise her not to tell professors that she's skipping out on class because \"something important\" came up, which implies that class isn't.  I'm inclined not to.\n\nAgain, her grade is not going to suffer for this in any way.  I may be an asshole, but I'm not a \\*monster\\*.\n\nETA (after class): I spoke to her briefly before class and told her that my tone may have been a bit snide, but I trust she had her answer.

Throwaway because my roommate knows my main.\n\nI (19F)began my freshman year this past August and because of everything happening we've been sent home for the semester, but I would still like to know if I was TA. My one roommate was a random pairing and got along swimmingly until it came to our sleep cycles.\n\nShe liked to get up 7am every day (about 2 hours before I did generally) to study before her classes start for the day in the dorm. Sometimes it did wake me up but it was never an issue I thought was worth voicing, I just accepted the fact that this is how it was living in close quarters. However, I tended to study pretty late, most nights until about 12. Since she was in bed by 10pm, I would generally leave and go to the library.\n\nI disliked going to and coming from the library late at night because there wasn't much security. In September, one day I decided to study in my dorm at night and used a desk light. It was the type where you could control the brightness and aim the light, so I kept it at the dimmest setting (it was still hard to see my notes) and aimed the opposite direction of her bed. She said that it was difficult for her to sleep with my light on, so I offered to order her a sleep mask. She said it was a great idea. It was a really cute silk one and she seemed to like it, but that night she said it just \"wasn't working\" and didn't elaborate. I turned off the light and went to bed. From then on I stopped studying in my dorm after 10 for the rest of the semester and basically left when she went to bed.\n\nI hit a breaking point when one time in January I was working on my laptop the night before an exam. She woke up (sans mask) and told me the screen was too bright. Here's where I may have been TA: I told her this exam was really important and so is the rest of my schoolwork and I cannot keep leaving to study. She was definitely upset and just kind of huffed and went to sleep. I stayed on my laptop and did not leave the dorm for the last two months to study for anything. She would occasionally wake up and ask \"how much longer do you think you'll be up?\" and it never escalated past that, but I still feel bad about her losing sleep.

Continue traveling as much as I have been (but in mostly cheap countries) - rent, food, bills, small weekly allowance for fun and bullshit, etc.\n2. pay for grad school without loans - I am not eligible for government loans so this was important for me. Private loans are crazy expensive.\n3. move to NY or London at the end of the two years with 3 months of living expenses, apartment deposit, etc.\n\nI have enough money for these things and that's really it.

If I blow through this money, I'm screwed because there is not contingency plan.\n\nMy sister passed away a little while ago and I told my family that I will not go to the funeral because I cannot afford it. They don't believe me. They think that I am being selfish and that I just don't want to go because I think that my life and what I am doing is more important. But that isn't the case. It would cost me about $3k USD for travel expenses. Flying last minute isn't cheap. I have had countless conversations with all of them over the past few days and it always ends in crying or other emotional shit and I honestly can't take it anymore. I sent them all a text last night which basically said, \"I'm not going, I cannot afford it, that is final, stop calling me\".  Now they are all pissed at me.\n\nFrom their perspective: I'm some spoiled brat who travels the world, is so rich he can afford grad school without loans, and can't be bothered to interrupt his wonderful existence for something important.\n\nAs I explained above, the reality of the situation isn't really what they see. Am I the asshole here?\n\nEDIT: I accept my asshole award. Thanks  for your opinion guys!\n        ",

I saw a similar post to this one so I decided I would share.\n\nRecently my girlfriend hasn't been hugging or showing any kind of affection. I'm cool with that and I won't force her to do anything with me. But I've had some of the worst months of my life recently. I switched majors in college and I still don't really know what I want to do with my life. I've been fragile lately and I've been trying to man up (as she would say it). My girlfriend has always been there for me and she points out my flaws so I can better myself. She keeps me in line and lets me know when I'm being a jerk.\n\nAnyway to the story. We were having dinner and my girlfriend was talking about how great our relationship is and how I'm doing great. But the longer she went on the more I realized that was very unhappy but I love her so much.\n\nSo I started crying. Not bawling, just silently crying with my head down. Her parents took a moment to notice but when they did, they were right beside me asking what was wrong. I talked to them for about 2 hours and they were amazing. But I could see my girlfriend was getting agitated and wanted to go home so we left.\n\nWhen we got home she told me how stupid I was for crying in front of her parents and she was very embarrassed.\n\nAITA? I feel really bad for embarrassing her but her parents were so helpful and reassuring.\n\nUpdate\n\nAfter posting this last night I took a look back on my life and realized what I want. I was strong when telling her that we needed to separate and think about things. I told her how much she means to me and that this was never what I wanted but I felt it was necessary. I realized how manipulative and abusive she was. I told her what I have been feeling the past few months and she disregarded that as me being a little dramatic. After she said this I told her she was not welcome in my home and she should pack her things. After telling her this she started to apologise and tried to seduce me (even though she hasn't touched me in over 2 weeks). I really wanted this to have a happy ending but it doesn't. Her parents contacted me and told how I was an idiot for abandoning their daughter. I have never been more shocked in my entire life. I couldn't fathom that people that were so helpful could completely emotionally destroy me after making a very hard decision. I'm in a feeling between relief and sadness. But surprisingly I feel better about myself in a new way. Thank you all for your advice and guidance. At the end of this road I will be happy. But the lows are hard and I need to stay strong to get through them. \n\nThank you!\n        ",

Instead of getting out of the car he told me that I should have brought a jacket and he didnt want to get cold as he sat there in his long sleeve shirt. \n\nWhen I got back in the car I mentioned to him that it would mean alot to me and would make feel taken care of if in a future scenario he would just fill up my tank for her when its cold outside in general, let alone just helping me stay warm and I asked him if he would maybe consider\u00a0doing that every once in a while as a nice gesture to me. (not pay to fill my tank just leaving the vehicle to fill it.) It means alot to me to feel like I can be looked out for in a relationship or like my partner cares if im shivering in the cold for example. I made sure to choose my words carefully and was very nice and respectful in how I talked to him about this.

So my girlfriend has naturally VERY curly hair, and she's always pretty (and I tell her this all the time regardless) but she's absolutely beautiful when she straightens it. When we first started dating she straightened it pretty much all the time, and her hair was straight when I met her, but after a few months she started straightening it less and less until finally she stopped all together. A few months ago I finally asked her about it and she told me that it damages her hair if she straightens it a lot so she only likes to do it on special occasions. This would be fine, except that she was straightening it ALL THE TIME at first, not just nice dates or parties or whatever, so I know it's total bs (I know it is damaging, I'm just saying it's bs that she cares because she clearly doesn't). Anyways, I played along and politely asked her when she was planning on straightening it again, to which she replied \"whenever you take me out on a date again\".\n\nThis is low. She knows I've been out of a job and haven't had the money to take her out very much, plus even when we were going on dates more frequently she hadn't done it in a while, and again she used to straighten it everyday anyway. I kept my cool and didn't call her out on it, but I reminded her that I can't afford to take her out, and it would be nice if she could just surprise me with it sometime. She apologized for her comment and said she could do that for me. A week went by, so I brought it up again and politely asked her when she planned on doing it. She said she thought I wanted it to be a surprise, which is fair, but I told her preferably within the month. She said she'd do it so long as I stopped \"harassing\" her about it, and I hardly call bringing it up twice in a week harassment but whatever, I respected her wishes and didn't bring it up again. Three months later, and she still hasn't done it, so I decide to ask her again. She apologizes and tells me she'll do it wednesday for movie night, and even brings the straightener to my house. Wednesday comes, and I ask her when she's going to do it, knowing that it takes a while. All day she just keeps saying she'll do it soon. Finally when it's like 7pm she snaps at me and accuses me of not loving her for who she is naturally, which is crazy, of course I do. She doesn't straighten her hair, we watch the movie in silence, she goes home, and texts me saying she needs some space. I haven't heard from her all day.\n\nedit: you guys are right about rating her. I wouldn't normally say that, I was just illustrating that she's beautiful either way but more beautiful with it, but I get why the rating thing is shitty\n\nedit 2: ok, I'm the asshole.

I told her it's his PC not mine, he paid for it so it's up to him. She then accused me of being a 'spineless parent'. I said I'm not, but I'm not going to force my son to share his own computer.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for taking a homeless person\u2019s dog? | I know the title sounds awful but please read the full story. Every time I walk to my gym I see this cute little dog looking miserable. The dog (it\u2019s a she) is sometimes with her owner, a homeless guy in his 40s, but most of the time she gets tied to a pole and left there for hours. I wanted to report this to authorities but I was told that because most shelters in our area are kill shelters that could be even worse for the dog. Recently it\u2019s been showing a lot in my city and seeing the poor dog tied to the pole was just too much. A few nights ago my fianc\u00e9 and I were walking back from a restaurant in the area and saw the dog alone again, we decided to take her home. When I told my mother she was outraged, she says homeless people need their animals to keep them company and that I had no right to take her. I told her a dog isn\u2019t a toy and people shouldn\u2019t get one if they can\u2019t look after it. My mom says I\u2019m cruel and don\u2019t care about human beings. I disagree and maintain that you should not have an animal you can\u2019t take care of. We took the dog to the vet, he said she\u2019s a little over a year, malnourished but not critically. We scheduled her shots and made sure she was okay. The plan is either to keep her or let my aunt\u2019s family adopt her. We have two cats (they\u2019re used to dogs) and we\u2019re leaving our apartment to live in a house with a backyard in a few months. On the other and my 8 year old cousin fell in love with the dog from the moment she saw her. Regardless, we all live in the same city and will be there for the doggy to shower her with love. I just hope my mom gets over it.\n\n*For anyone wondering about the legality of what I did, my vet helped me out to make sure the dog was reported as abandoned and everything was legal. We\u2019ll be able to make the adoption official after a 30 day wait period.*\n\nUPDATE: as suggested by some of you in the comments, yesterday my fianc\u00e9 and my brother went to talk to the homeless guy to let him know where the dog is and how to claim ownership. However, authorities ruled this as animal abuse, so if the guy does claim ownership he can face charges (the guy knows this as well). Typically the waiting period for us to adopt the dog if the owner doesn't claim her would be 30 days, but because this is a case of abuse we might be able to finalize the adoption earlier. Seems like my aunt will adopt the dog since they're a family of 5 and someone's always home to take care of the dog. I understand the people telling me I should have talked to the guy earlier and I was a coward for not doing it. For people asking about temperatures, my city is in the mountains in northern Europe, snow and sub-freezing temperatures are a regular occurrence here. For people telling me to return the dog because the homeless guy is lonely, animals don't exist for our entertainment and loneliness isn't a valid excuse for animal abuse. Plenty of homeless people care for their animals and don't leave them alone in the cold.\n        ",

I told her she was going to grow up into an amazing cat, because she was around humans all her life so she'll have plenty of room to become a polite cuddly house cat. I have a cat that had to be bottle fed and who turned out the sweetest boy ever and she always said she wanted a cat just like him. She was excited at the prospect of having a pet that was going to be as chill as mine and the cat's disposition seemed to be that of a social animal who loved humans, always following humans around and crying to be picked up and just generally very at ease around humans, showing her belly and sleeping and all. \n\nHere's where things went wrong... M. let the cat do anything it pleased, never imparted any discipline of any kind, never said no. As she grew up the cat got more and more difficult to deal with, and while she's far from a nightmare she's bitey, aggressive, and hates strangers. She followed none of my suggestions (don't let her play with your hands, introduce her to strangers soon etc) and now M. will occasionally bring up that I told her she was gonna be so sweet but she became a little monster. A little monster she loves but a little monster none the less. \n\nBut what can I do when I tell her \"look if you give her food while you're preparing meals, it's gonna be bad\" and she snaps at me like \"I'll do what I want with my cat\" without letting me explain the very basic correlation of cat gets food while you cook > cat jumps on the stove > cat could eventually hurt itself. And of course now M. has to keep her locked out of the kitchen while she cooks. (no injuries were sustained, just a scare of hot oil potentially getting dumped all over the place) \n\nI really feel like I might snap next time she tells me the cat was supposed to grow up sweet, I think she should hear that she spoiled her pet to the point where she thinks she's the alpha of the household, but she'll be very, very upset at me. \n\nIs her thinking I \"gave her a bad deal\" better than hurting her?\n        ",

Just a completely casual Saturday afternoon with the wives away shopping and us just chilling on the patio sipping on the beers from my fridge. At one point a friend suggests we all go in on some pizza, and we all enthusiastically agree. We order 3 pies from a local chain, approximately ~$10 per pie (including delivery fees) for about $30 total.\n\nAs it's my home, I pull out my phone and place the order using the restaurant's mobile app, and I realize at this time that I have enough reward points in my account to cover the cost of one of the pizzas, bringing our new total to around $20. So of course I apply the reward points (which to be fair, I didn't mention to my friends as it didn't seem important), and when the pizza arrives I tip the driver $6 (I've delivered food before, I always tip around 20% of the total cost regardless of coupons and discounts, so I tipped 20% of the original $30 cost).\n\nI tell my two friends \"$10 each, $12 if you want to cover part of the tip.\" They both happily agree to $12 and we enjoy our pizza and beers in peace.\n\nThe trouble begins at the end of the night when the wives come home and give us a knowing grin and eye-roll about how \"Of course you boys just drank beers and had a pizza party wink wink you're so predictable.\" One of my buddies tells his wife (jokingly) it's cheaper than their shopping outings, and she runs to the kitchen to grab the receipt. They notice the total was only $20 and start giving me grief about essentially \"fleecing\" them on the cost. I explained that I had reward points built up with that particular chain and that it was either pay $10 cash or use $10 worth of my reward points, so what's the difference?\n\nThey got upset claiming I should have passed the savings along to the group where we all ended up paying for the $20 total and tip split three ways instead of the $30 plus tip. As I mentioned earlier, we're all approximately 35 year old men who have all had salaried careers for close to a decade, and we're fortunate that a $10 expense is not really something to worry about. So I was a little surprised to receive so much flak, and even went as far as to say \"If you really feel I was trying to trick you so I didn't have to pay, I'll happily pick up the whole tab.\" They seemed to take that as an admission of guilt. Oops.\n\nI also deal with numbers daily at my job so in my head I'm thinking \"Ok... $36 split 3 ways is $12 a head, $26 split 3 ways is about $9 a head... do they really think I'm trying to cheat them out of a difference of $3 per person? Especially after we just spent a great afternoon together and we drank around $40 of my beer with no worries?\"\n\nSo...

We both get along with her mom,  she was genuinely excited for us when we told her about our baby. \n\nKylees mother asks me if I plan to vaccinate.  I told her of course I do. She then starts to say some  condescending things to me about how I must not know anything about the research on vaccines and autism, she feels bad for my daughter, and she hopes I\u2019ll take time to \u201cresearch\u201d, then sends me links to a bunch of antivax blogs.

There are now over 40 active cases of the measles in the county we live in. After the outbreak, I have gone strict no contact with Kylee. It breaks my heart. We love each other (she even calls me mom sometimes). But to me, it is not worth the risk of exposing my baby. She can\u2019t get vaccinated for measles until she\u2019s 1.\n\nMy bf sees our daughter for a few hours every week.

He says \u201cAs much as I want to vaccinate Kylee, I\u2019d have to take her mom to court, and that would ruin how well we get along.\u201d\n\nBasically he values getting along with his baby mama over me and our daughter. I told him that I won\u2019t wait around for two years because of this, then just pretend like it never happened. I feel betrayed that he won\u2019t take action to protect BOTH of our girls. He admits he is afraid of them getting sick, but he knows \u201cHer mom would go psycho over this and it\u2019s not worth the fight.\u201d He also says \u201cYou knew how Kylees mom felt about vaccines, but I still chose to have our daughter regardless.\u201d Was I supposed to abort because getting his daughter vaccinated would be a fight?\n\nAm I being ridiculous?

I'll try to be short.\n\nMy grandfather had a minor cerebrovascular accident a few months ago (he was living alone). If a neighbor hadn't found him in time, the outcome would have been much worse. Therefore, my mother decided to rent a house in the town she lives in and bring my grandfather there, as she was the only relative to volunteer.\n\nA little backstory now. My mother is divorced and she has to take care of ABSOLUTELY everything in their new home. My grandfather is feeling significantly better because he was taken good care of.\n\nI live with them ATM, and help with house chores whenever I can.\n\nAnd I can't help but notice that he doesn't seem to appreciate our effort at all. He established his own rules since he moved here, which was somewhat expected, cause he's a typical grumpy old man.\n\nMe and my mother have to wake up at 6AM because he demands to come in our room and watch TV. He watches TV until late evening, non-stop. It's the TV my mother bought and brought in the new home because she needed a little relief from all her stress, but she's not allowed to use it. My grandfather has a smaller but fully functional TV in his bedroom, but of course he likes my mom's 4K TV more.\n\nWe also have to cook and serve his food at the exact time he wants (which contradicts our previous meal schedule).\n\nDoes he even thank us? Nope. He talks to his friends via phone and complains how bad he feels with us, how bored he is, how harsh my mother is with him.\n\nIt's true, she is stressed and sometimes lashes at him. All she needs is a mere \"thank you\", she's expressed this, with no results.\n\nYesterday, she decided what's enough is enough. My grandpa's not allowed to use our 4K TV until 10AM, because, honesty, we need a good sleep. Also, at 8PM, he's sent back to his bedroom, as opposed to the schedule he wanted (11PM). I agree with my mother, I didn't even try to defend my grandfather. He's not happy with these rules. He complains about his small TV. My mother had an argument with him just a few minutes ago.\n\nI have to agree that her anger is justified, but she now kinda feels like an asshole, because she understands that old men can be difficult and we have to understand them.\n\nSo, Reddit, is she the asshole?

My fianc\u00e9 (who was present) refuses to believe it was an accident. | Using a throwaway since fiance and I are several of the same subs. \n\nThis is a scenario where I know I fucked up in so many ways but was I the asshole? \n\nLast night was me and Fiance's 4 year anniversary of her asking me out. We have a great relationship, wedding planned for December and I really do love her. We went to a semi upscale but casual Italian place that she loves. Served seemed friendly but after her fried few trips to the table my fianc\u00e9 said \"babe she's flirting with you.\" I was like no way (I'm not one of those guys who gets flirted with) but I started paying attention and sure enough she was defintely being super polite to me and sort of under handed and dismissive to my fianc\u00e9. I tried to tell my fianc\u00e9 I saw it now but let's not let it ruin our dinner. It just got worse as the server was making far too many trips to our table and as the bill and card was being returned the server did this pouty look and told me \"i didn't get so many likes on my last Instagram post will you check it out?\" And she shoved her phone oh my face and it was her in bikini.\n\nmy fianc\u00e9 finally exploded and told the server how she'd been rude and dismissive all night and she wanted to see the manager. The server was pretty rude in her tone and said \"how about I get you a piece tiramisu on me?\" My fianc\u00e9 said \"that's fucking it, we're leaving!\" And stormed out of the restaurant. \n\nI was so stunned I had no idea what to do because I didn't want to leave her outside by herself and I assumed we weren't dining and dashing so I grabbed the bill, hurriedly filled in a tip amount that made sense, copied it over to my version of the check and left.\n\nWe drove home and my fianc\u00e9 was on fire, she was so mad I was totally agreeing with her and saying that the server had crossed so many lines and we'd never go back. At a light she said the server probably wrote her number on the check and she wanted to see it. I fished it out of my wallet and then she really freaked out. She said I tipped her $50! I was like no, I did $20 or somthing because i was in a hurry to catch up with her and didn't do exact math. She was like \"no you fucking asshole you tipped her $50!\" I asked her to show me the check and sure enough $50 on a $76 tab. I even totaled it to $126. I was ao sure to copy the numbers over exactly from the server copy of the bill I'm so afraid this right.\n\nWell fianc\u00e9 is even more furious now because she thinks this is solid proof I enjoyed the flirting and is questing what went on in the restaurant after she left. I tried to explain I was nervous and in a rush and I literally didn't see the sever again. She doesn't believe any of it. We were supposed to have a romantic night at our new house but she wanted to go back to her apartment and didn't even say goodbye as she slammed the door to my truck and I think she has my number blocked.\n\nWas I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: I guess I\u2019ve been banned for trying to point out the blatant karma farming and then arguing about it with the farmer. That\u2019s all on me. But I\u2019m not ignoring anyone and judgments. But this is 200% factual and the way it happened sorry if people don\u2019t believe it.

Turns out he has a genetic issue that could cause infertility after a certain age. Doctors say we could keep trying but I\u2019m getting older (34) too and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to keep putting it off. \n\nWe want to go with a sperm donor but this is where we disagree. I want to ask one of my best friends, because I\u2019ve known him since we were kids and I trust his character 110%. Husband wants to go with a donor, which makes me uncomfortable because we\u2019ll never get to meet this guy and know what kind of person he actually is. I don\u2019t care about height or eye color or degrees or whatever. I just need to know that the ~~father~~ biological parent of my future children is a kind and upstanding person. \n\nMy husband is freaking out over my suggestion because he thinks it implies I have feelings for my friend, which is so ridiculous I can\u2019t even start. I told him my friend lives in another country halfway around the world and I see him as a brother, but I know and trust him which is the key difference between him and other donors. \n\nSo now we\u2019ve come to a standstill. Husband says 1000% no but I think he\u2019s being extremely closed minded and negligent of my fears and anxieties. I know it\u2019s a pride thing for him but I wish he could at least acknowledge my fears. I simply do not want to get pregnant then raise a child with the DNA of a stranger. Is that so unreasonable? AITA?\n\n**EDIT** : To add a few more details, this friend of mine has been staunchly childfree since his teens. He would not be interested in being in our kid\u2019s life as anything beyond a friendly distant family friend. \n\nBut another reason I want to choose him is that I like the idea of the kid (after reaching adulthood) being given the choice of reaching out to his/her biological dad and knowing about him. My own father died when I was 6 and I\u2019ve always felt like there was a hole in me even though I had very loving stepdads. There were aspects of my personality that I couldn\u2019t explain that was dissimilar to all my halfsibs but everyone I met told me how similar I am to my dad, so I can\u2019t help but feel like children should know the person who gave them half their DNA, even if they don\u2019t call him \u201cdad.\u201d\n\n**EDIT2**: Copying pasting a comment I wrote below:\n\n\nOk obviously everyone is getting really hung up over the word \u201cfather\u201d which I should probably edit out. \n\nI DO NOT INTEND ON THIS FRIEND BEING A FATHER IN ANY CAPACITY. \n\nWhen I said father I probably should\u2019ve said \u201cDNA donor\u201d because that\u2019s what I meant. I don\u2019t need this guy to be a dad because my husband would be all the dad our baby needs. All I\u2019m saying is that it would be nice to know about our dna donor in a more personal sense, since our literal child will be half him genetically. And I will need to carry and give birth to this child on top of that.\n\nI don\u2019t feel comfortable with anonymous donors because I\u2019ll never get to know them as people or as friends. I know that people are going to say \u201cpersonality is how you raise them\u201d and I agree to an extent but not completely. I think some traits are inheritable and there\u2019s nothing that can change that. And I think it\u2019s pretty naive to believe that personality traits somehow can\u2019t be inherited but intelligence, physical attributes, illness, etc. can. \n\nFinally, with my first edit I only meant that it would be nice for our kid to eventually have the CHOICE of meeting his/her \u201cdna donor.\u201d I know there are some sperm banks that have this option but again, without knowing who the guy is very well, I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable letting my kid know a complete stranger.\n        ",

I said that would be fine, but asked if we could still stay until the end of the month, to which he agreed.\n\nThe boat is docked at a covered marina, with a monthly rent ($450). In order to transfer the slip into Dans name, he\u2019s have to present registration and insurance. I told him this repeatedly, before and after he bought the boat. I did not want to pay for moorage on a boat I don\u2019t own. He said it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. He did ask how much registration and insurance would be. I told him what I paid, which was next to nothing, and who my insurer was. He said no problem and he\u2019d get right on it.\n\nOne week after the sale, Dan called to inform me that the registration was going to be way higher ($1,500). I felt terrible and apologized profusely. I told him that since that was unexpected that we could deal with the $1500 he owed me whenever. He appreciated that and said it was really no problem, just surprising.\n\nFast forward until the final day of the month. Dan had still not registered nor insured the boat that is now legally released from my name (with docs to prove it). If he doesn\u2019t get it done that day, I\u2019m on the hook for his moorage. He calls me to tell me that I misled him. He couldn\u2019t get insurance because the company I had used didn\u2019t like his lack of boating experience. He said I knew about that requirement and should have warned him of it. He also was still angry from paying a high registration fee and felt he was misled and that I tricked him into buying something he couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nHe had been in possession of the boat for 18 days at this point, and we even moved out early because he alluded to the fact he was homeless and needed it. \n\nThe marina has said they can cut me from my lease, but that means he\u2019ll be towed out from the slip.

She's in her second year of college vying for computer science, but still a pre-major as she finishes her core credits.\n\nAt home, she's been on her computer for an average of 10 or 8 hours a day when she doesn't have class or work. As soon as she comes home she logs on saying she has homework to do, but when I usually check in it looks like my daughter is playing a game and typing in chat.

I also know she's interested in video games so I know she plays them from time to time.\n\nI think she's been spending too much time on her computer so I put curfews on her usage and began taking her laptop at night to make sure she heads to bed instead of playing games. She's tried to make excuses to why she needs her computer but I don't believe that absolutely every assignment needs a computer, else why would she still need to buy textbooks?

AITA?\n\nedit for common questions: She is not failing classes but her time spent with the family has drastically dropped.

My wife didn't want to sit in. She has seen the post and hasn't spoken to me extensively to it yet, other than saying after the discussion with my daughter's that she feels she has failed as a mother in letting the both of them feel like they are trapped at home. We have not talked further.\n\nIt turns out my 17 year old (Amy) found my post and showed it to her sister (Zoe) whom I originally posted about, and was much more emotional about it than her. They prepped arguments. They were both explaining they think I was out of line and disrespectful for multiple things in what I said in both the OP and in the comments. After hearing what they had to say I agreed. They demanded I apologized and I did.\n\nZoe showed me programs on her laptop that she explained were either class sites, code work, and other related things. That and other comments from the previous post plus private conversations helped put things in perspective of how much workload is reliant on her computer and access to internet. I asked to see her grades and saw that some classes were hovering in the 80-70% grade. Her university requires at least 75% to pass the class, so it was possible that she was failing. Zoe says that she has had less time to work on school due to work. I wanted to voice being disappointed but Amy interrupted me and asked me to please listen. She's visibly upset and not the kind to speak loudly, which was surprising.\n\nZoe confessed she started working to get herself money to buy things and save for things like recently, another laptop she can claim full ownership to, and for renting an apartment to move out to with Amy, with absolutely no financial help from me to get their own place to stay. They live at home, so that hasn't happened. With Zoe's current job's payrate and the work she has at school anyway, it wouldn't have been possible to move, but the intent they had was hard to hear as it confirmed many comments from the previous post. For reference, Zoe started to work when she was 15. However, Zoe has made 0 effort to contribute to house bills pays for nothing such as the internet, the car she uses right now, the water, heating, etc. She is an adult but hasn't paid for any utilities, speaking as if she were a tenant. I said if she made more contributions to bills then I would be less strict on rules.\n\nZoe spoke about her cousin. She has said that when their older cousin (whom my daughters are very close to) found out that she and Amy were never taught how to budget money, had a word with my wife and then taught my daughters how to save their money and to get things like credits cards. I've never known about them having credit cards before. When Zoe asked her cousin how to start moving out and doing what she says are \"adult things\", their cousin gave her guidelines in what look for in apartments, the payment plans, or just starting smaller in getting a car. She quoted her cousin and said that she believes they both should have been taught these things much earlier. I don't appreciate how their cousin (supposedly) spoke about how and when my daughters should be taught things but see their point.\n\nWe eventually came to a compromise. The previous living conditions (must stay in the house through college for help in moving out later) was dropped. Zoe no longer has her laptop or computer privileges taken away, but I am adamant that she has to be in bed by 1am or it'll be forced off. If she can lose 30lbs then there will be no curfew. She gave me an attitude but eventually agreed to the conditions, which I thought were plenty fair. They ended saying they respect me, but don't love me. That's where we stand.\n\nNow, my family has yet to have a meal together. My daughters go out together while my wife makes something for herself and leaves me to my own devices. Though it's not uncommon for us to not sit together, it feels like this is on purpose. I'm unsure where to go from here.\n        ",

But I still have sensible rules like no turning off iphone tracking, always answer my texts or calls immediately or within a reasonable time frame when not in school or practice, no dead battery excuses. But I know teenagers can be sneaky, so I have a backup tracking plan that I keep secret from her. I have an extra older version iphone on my family plan that I use as an emergency phone. I hide this phone somewhere in the car that I let my daughter drive, kept on silent. It\u2019s always charged so I can track it when my daughter is out. \n\nThis past weekend, my daughter told me she was going to her friend Brett\u2019s house to prepare for an academic competition and an oratory event. When I checked on her iphone and the secret iphone, the locations matched up. She was at her friend\u2019s house. After dinner, I checked again. Curiously, her iphone\u2019s location was at her friend\u2019s house, but my secret iphone was clearly in downtown near all the bars and nightlife. I called my daughter and she told me everything was fine, including the car. \n\nI drove to my car\u2019s find iphone location to see if maybe it was wrong, and eventually found my car parked along the street near the LGBT night life area. I called Brett\u2019s father (Brett\u2019s parents are divorced and the dad does not live with Brett, and Brett\u2019s mom had the night shift so I called the dad). \n\nBefore Brett\u2019s dad got there, I walked around asking the bouncers at the bars if they had seen my daughter or her friend (I showed them photos). I finally talked to one who remembered turning away my daughter and Brett earlier in the night for trying to use fake IDs. I was livid. I wandered the area and eventually found my daughter and Brett hanging out at a coffee house. I waited for Brett\u2019s dad to park before going in. I asked him what his understanding of the situation was, and he told me as far as his ex told him, the kids were supposed to be at home doing prep work for a oratory competition. \n\nI told Brett\u2019s dad where I was and he and I walked into the cafe together to retrieve our kids. After we returned home, my daughter confessed to trying to sneak into a gay club with Brett, who apparently is closeted to his parents and school. She was most upset that I outed Brett to his parents this way. But she has not given me any reason to trust her or her friend Brett given their behavior this weekend. \n\nStricter rules are on the way. She continues to think I am the biggest villain in her entire world but really, if I hadn\u2019t installed an emergency phone in the car, I wouldn\u2019t have known the shenanigans these two were up to under the guise of studying. Sure, I violated her and Brett\u2019s privacy, but I feel it\u2019s justified.\n        ",

The problem is that she doesn't under any circumstances want to take my name because my name is also a swear word. Think something like Cocks or Fuchs - it's a name that I admit has been kinda a burden at times, especially at high school. Still, it's my name and call me overly traditional but I never saw myself talking my wife's name. My family would go livid if I did that. \n\nAlso my fianc\u00e9e has a very noticeably ethnic name (it's not Mohammed but it's something very close) and as I'm a super white guy it would feel weird having a name that made people think I was something I'm not, it would be awkward introducing myself and on a selfish level I'm worried it would affect job applications etc because I know that there's research that suggests that hirers sometimes reject candidates based on non white sounding names.\n\nShe suggested hyphenating so that we could keep both our names and have them the same. Best of both worlds apparently! But hyphenating is so long and confusing and I still don't want to run the risk of having a name that could affect my job prospects. So she suggested merging them and making a new name but there's really no good name you can make from both our names, they're too different and it sounds awkward. \n\nSo now I can only think of us having different names because neither of us are budging on this. I told her this and she got upset at the thought of us having different names and us not being immediately recognisable as a married couple. She said that my name was embarrassing and I got teased for it as a kid so why would I want her to take it and also saddle our future kids with it. I said our kids could take her name and she got sad at the thought of me having a different name to our children. She said that my name is embarrassing whereas hers isn't and she doesn't know why I'm so attached to it when it caused me such grief in high school.

Whether it's words or diagrams or explanations, so it's pretty important to be able to read.\n\nHere's the problem: i'm colourblind and i cannot distinguish the difference between red and green ... like at all. It just looks the same to me.\n\nThis is a common problem so i ALWAYS carry a black and blue white board marker pen with me to give to a teacher in case there isn't a blue one around. It saves time and embarrassment on my behalf.\n\nSo i tell my professor my problem and the first lecture goes fine, he doesn't use green, and uses my blue and black pens instead (idk why but this room only had green and red). The next lecture however, i give over my pen and he starts to use the green and red pens to explain graphs and stuff. Completely un-understandable to me. So i raise my hand in a room of like.. 120 people.. and ask him if he can use the blue pen i gave him so i can actually see the difference in lines.\n\nThe professor then kinda... scoffed? And said he couldn't change now or the rest of the class would get confused. I just nodded and looked away because his tone was so condescending. The rest of lecture he used green and red so i just couldn't write up my notes.\n\n(Insert- a super amazing girl in front of me asked for my email and sent me her notes that she was creating on her computer. She even changed all the colouring so i could see it properly and i was so shocked when i got them i nearly cried (people dont do this often lol)).\n\nAnyway i email the professor and ask him one last time if he could just use a blue pen instead of red or green and he emailed back almost instantly to tell me that a lot of work is done in green and red and ill probably struggle with it anyway! \n\nI got so mad i emailed up the head of our school and told them everything i said here. The next day rumour was going around he was suspended and i got a confirmation of it later that day when the head of school contacted me for a meeting in a few days.\n\nI feel pretty bad.

Throwaway account bc I don\u2019t want this situation on my main account.\n\nI recently moved 1000 miles to be with my husband in his hometown. We have a nice little house with lots of space and a fenced backyard. It\u2018s like a dream come true... sorta.\n\nWe both have always wanted a dog, so my husband and I agreed to split the cost of our dog 50/50. We contacted the breeder before I moved. I originally wanted to wait until I settled in and was actually THERE, but my husband was too excited and didn\u2019t want to pay for the breeder to hold the puppy for us. It was an extra $50 for each week the puppy was held, and we would need her to be held for a full month... so $200 extra. So I sent him 50% of the cost and he got the puppy about a month before I would be moving in. \n\nMy husband took the puppy to stay at his parents\u2019  house because his apartment at the time didn\u2019t allow pets. So our puppy was with my husband, his mom/my MIL, his dad/my FIL, and his little 8-year-old sister for an entire month.\n\nUnsurprisingly, his family got extremely attached to our puppy, especially his little sister. They walked her, fed her, took her to get her vaccinations, and started training her together as a family.  They LOVED our puppy and wanted to be involved, so they would insist for paying for things instead of letting me or my husband pay. I was very grateful and figured they were helping us out. No big deal, right?\n\nThen I moved in with my husband and shit hit the fan when we were about to take our puppy with us.\n\nHis little sister started bawling her eyes out and his mom very firmly said that the dog was now theirs since they cared for her for a full month. I expected my husband to say something but he didn\u2019t.\n\nI was pissed! I told them that this was OUR dog and they knew from the get-go that she would be coming with me and my husband when I moved here. All of the things they did for our puppy was a way for them to say they could keep her! \n\nMIL and I got into a huge argument, his little sister was inconsolable. My husband suggested we just let them keep the puppy (wtf???) and we can visit sometimes. I said fuck no! I told them the dog was MINE and MY HUSBAND\u2019S, end of story. The fight was really bad and hurtful things were said.\n\nWe ended up taking our puppy and his parents have cut him off completely so he\u2019s pissed at me for creating conflict in his family. I\u2019m pissed because what the actual fuck? We had to money to pay for everything the puppy needed, we could\u2019ve afforded the holding fees if he hadn\u2019t insisted on getting the puppy early, imo this is all his fault... \n\nOur mutual friends are almost evenly split about this. Some say I\u2019m a heartless bitch who took a puppy away from a family that loved and cared for her, others say my in-laws are crazy and manipulative. Idk what to believe at this point... and I know this isn\u2019t over.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the input so far. Here\u2019s a few points I want to address:\n\n1. I was attached to my puppy. I spent almost every night on FaceTime talking to her and watching her play. We picked her specifically for her breed and temperament. In my mind she was my dog from the start and I was already attached to her. She wasn\u2019t replaceable like everyone wants to believe. She has now been with me for 3 1/2 weeks in person and is doing great.\n\n2. In-laws did not offer to buy her, they expected to just keep her, though I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve sold her regardless.\n\n3. We went with a breeder because we wanted a specific breed that would fit into our lifestyle. Breeder is reputable and AKC registered. I personally don\u2019t see a problem supporting reputable breeders but that\u2019s a controversial topic and not what I\u2019m asking about.\n\nEDIT #2: A few more things I want to address:\n\n1. I have no intention of giving my in-laws my puppy at this point, whether they offer to pay for her or not.\n\n2. I reimbursed them for the money they spent on our puppy. I have no idea if they accepted the money or not, I left it in their mailbox.\n\n3. Again, I\u2019m not asking about adopt vs shop. Controversial topic but not relevant to my post. I went to a breeder for the reasons stated above and do not feel like arguing about it anymore.\n        ",

Overall though I didn't feel like it was too bad (it was a bad date but not a disaster) I was also being told not to worry so much but I still did. Finally I drop this person off, which was also awkward because they attempted a hug and I hate being touched so I just tried my best to not make it obvious that I was trying to get it over with as soon as possible but I think my facial expression and body language were a bit of a dead giveaway. I also attempted a high five before that when saying bye which was also insanely awkward in delivery.\n\nSo I drive home pretty upset because I feel like I really made myself look silly and post some things to cheer me up, and by morning things were fine but later the following day I made a joke about whether or not I would embarrass myself that day (which I didn't think was a big deal) but  by the end of my shift I've been blocked by my date.\n\nThat upset me a bit too, but I got a bit curious and felt like there had to be some reason for it, I wasn't blocked on one of their social medias which was linked with their music and everything and found they had been talking about the situation with my friend not liking their music on there. They pretty much seemed dissatisfied that my friend held this opinion as well as the fact that I brought it up, I knew they were upset with my friend on the date (who was not present) but not me. If they had made indication that they were upset I wouldn't have been offended by that. I didn't see why they had to block me or basically rant and not even tell me themselves but that's their choice and I have no issue with that, plus I'm doing this in search for the very strong possibility that I'm too dense to realize how little tact I can have sometimes.\n        ",

Last year we went to Greece together and we worked great as a friend group, no fights occured and we got along well. We're currently planning our next vacation to Greece.\n\nI have a childhood friend \"Amy\" (also 19) who isn't part of my regular friend group. Amy and i see each other on a regular basis but she doesn't like parties, bars or hanging out with more than three people at once so usually, it's just me and Amy hanging out alone or we go to a restaurant.\n\nI love Amy and i consider her to be one of my closest friends but she can be quite difficult. Amy's biggest problem is communication. She never outright says what she wants or how she feels and leaves \"hints\" for people to figure out what's going on with her.\n\nFor example if Amy wants to hang out she'll text how bored she is, then how lonely and so on. She basically hints at what she wants but doesn't say it out loud and leaves it up to me to figure out what she wants and then ask her, like in my example, if she wants to hang out. Sometimes that gets very frustrating.\n\nYesterday i met up with Amy and i shortly mentioned that me and my three friends are planning on going on vacation again. Amy then hinted the entire evening that she wants to come with us, even tough she doesn't like my friends.\n\nSome of her hints were \"that vacation sounds like so much fun but i don't have anyone to go on vacation with\" and \"wow i have always wanted to go Greece but i probably won't go anytime soon\" and hints like that. It was hard not asking her because the only nice answer to those questions would be if i asked her if she wanted to come along.\n\nHonestly, i don't want her to come with us. Amy doesn't even like my friends and since we're planning this to be a party vacation i know she won't enjoy herself.\n\nThus far she hasn't asked me straight up if she can go on vacation with us so i'm choosing to ignore her hints that she wants to come.\n\nSo AITA for choosing to ignore Amy's hints that she wants to come on vacation with us?\n        ",

(We're big tattoo folk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow here's the tough part. His family and my family have been judging us pretty harshly about it. My brother thought it was outrageous so ask a man to change his name. My fianc\u00e9's brother thought is was ridiculous, that we were throwing away the family history, and that we might as well change our name to anything if we were going to do something so crazy. My partner is very sweet and he obviously takes this very much to heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm honestly lost about what to do.

Thank you thank you thank you so much!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a side note, my lovely partner found this post and was really touched. He wrote to his brother (he left a comment with it below) about it and his brother wrote back a really kind and considerate answer, telling us he understands and to do whatever makes us happy. So everything is wonderful and I feel so much more ready to own the decision and be proud of it!

This is a very unimportant problem in the scheme of things but still interested to hear what others think...\n\nI (33F) have been friends with V (32F) since we were 16 years old as part of our school friendship group. Whilst not particularly close day to day, we've always made the effort to meet up when possible and share semi-regular messages in our group chat to keep in touch. \n\nBackground: When V was pregnant with her first son a couple of years ago (the first of the group to have a baby), we arranged a getaway to celebrate with her properly. Unsurprisingly, the topic of baby names came up and, whilst V knew she was having a boy, she wanted to keep the name as a surprise until after he was born. Fair enough, the conversation continued round the group. I put forward my personal choice of Henry James (first/middle name) and explained why these names are important to me. Short story is that they have been carried through my family tree for generations, and would honour both my mum's side (Henry) and my (deceased) dad's side (James). I knew I was a long way off having kids when I said this, and that a lot of stars would need to align to a) have a baby boy and b) have my partner agree but hey, it didn't hurt to dream. V was of course there for this conversation and commented on how special this naming combination would be to me.\n\nIt's probably very obvious where this story is going and you would be right. Fast forward a couple of years, V had her first son (named George Paul after her/her husbands family) and recently gave birth to her second baby boy named - you guessed it - Henry James. Upon hearing the news, I sent my love to the family and didn't make any comment on the choice of name but, to be honest, I still feel completely blindsided by her decision and not sure how best to proceed. I understand I don't have exclusive rights to this combination of names (and that kids aren't forthcoming on my horizon at the moment anyway) but I still feel like it was pretty shitty of her knowing what she does. As far as I know, she (and her husband) chose the name based on her liking of traditional names, not because they have a particular meaning or connection. \n\nWIBTA if I mention something to her? Or should I just suck it up and deal with it. The name is set in stone no matter what.\n\nEdit: Verdict accepted! Thanks to everyone who commented.

I don't like Facebook, and have hardly used it in over a decade. I have not made a top level post in something like 5 years and haven't accepted or sent a friend request in nearly as long. I have some family and friends added that I do interact with occasionally offline, but most of my friends list are people I knew and cared about as a teenager and haven't kept up with at all, nor feel a strong desire to catch up with. I would have happily deleted the whole thing quite a while ago if not for my wife's insistence that I keep it \"just in case\" I ever do feel like connecting with those people again. That's not something I think I'll ever feel inclined to do, but my wife uses Facebook often to keep up with people and feels I'm missing out and should be sharing and engaging more online about our life and our family, and so I keep my profile and scroll through my feed maybe once every couple of months.\n\nOver time we've settled into an agreement where she does all the posting she wants about our family and life events and will just tag me in things. She no longer seems to be frustrated with my disinterest in sharing online and has more or less accepted the fact that I don't enjoy interacting with acquaintances online in that way. Things have been fine, up until last week. We were traveling, my wife's phone had died and she asked to borrow mine so that she could finish a book she had been reading. That was fine, she borrowed my phone and finished her book, everything was good.\n\nThen yesterday my wife suggested that I log in to see if some of our friends had posted anything about their Christmas morning. I open facebook and to my surprise, I have dozens of notifications, which is odd as I usually only have a handful due to her tagging me in posts. It turns out that after my wife had finished her book, she decided to get on facebook on my phone and update my profile picture, which had been several years out of date. Apparently this sent a notice to people on my friends list who hadn't seen me post in years, and the new picture of me and my kids got over a hundred likes and dozens of comments from people I haven't spoken with in ages, telling me how cute my family is and asking how I'd been and expressing a desire to catch up.\n\nI was unhappy with my wife for posting on my account and didn't feel like responding to any of the comments, so I just deactivated my profile. My wife is insisting that it was rude of me to not respond to people who were genuinely expressing an interest in my life. I think it was rude of her to put me in a position of having to respond to those people when it's been well understood for a long time that I don't enjoy it.\n\nAITA for ignoring all my old acquaintances who wanted to catch up and just deactivating my profile?\n\nEdit: Lots of comments are now focusing on how my wife's behavior was problematic and not whether or not my response makes me an asshole. I agree that it's not great that she posted from my account, she knows I didn't appreciate it and it obviously won't be happening again with my account shut down. I don't think my wife's interest in social media or usage of it is atypical, which is not to say that I think it's good or healthy, only that the comments suggesting that she derives all of her worth or confidence from it are off base. I've not tried to paint her in a bad light here and hope it doesn't come off that way. She's more engaged with social media than I am, but so is almost everyone else, and I don't think she has an \"obsession\" with our online presence any more than most. Just wanted to clarify that. I don't feel like this was some huge violation of trust or an attempt to manipulate me into using Facebook or any of that, just a bit of poor judgement on her part.

He claims that he doesn\u2019t care if my weight fluctuates, if my skin is broken out, or anything else, but said that out of respect I should dye my hair back, darker this time. He also says that he is finding it hard to be physically attracted to me with this change, because not only is blonde not attractive to him, but that my hair just looks downright bad. \n\nI feel like that\u2019s fucking ridiculous. I\u2019m an adult and should not have to ask my boyfriend for permission to dye my hair. I can understand him disliking it, but telling me that it\u2019s disrespectful and blaming me for our lack of physical chemistry is asshole-ish.  I feel like if A were to shave his beard or get a buzz cut, I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to make it about myself. \n\nToday, I\u2019m heading to the beauty supply store to buy darker hair dye because I feel so humiliated. Reddit, I need your judgements: AITA?\n\ntldr: I dyed my hair a color my boyfriend doesn\u2019t like and he says it\u2019s disrespectful\n        ",

My husband says he likes it and to him I am the most beautiful woman in the world. I believe him.

I have had other kinds of non-plasticsurgical operations before (6 in total + EDIT: they were 2 cesarean sections, 2 knee surgeries, appendectomy and an ankle operation so NOT plastic surgeries, people have misunderstood this..) and am not afraid of going under the knife. I really hate my nose and the doc will make it as small as possible but so it still fits my facial features. The operation will be done in a very good private hospital in my home country (the Nordics). I will take the money off my own savings account, there'll be plenty left and more coming in. I have dreamed of this for years.\n\nAita for not even discussing this with my husband but going ahead as planned? We have two kids (7 and 4yo boys) whom I will explain that it is done for medical reasons as they don't need to know about my insecurities at such young age, we'll discuss this once they're grownups; luckily they have their father's nose and are handsome boys. I have arranged for child care help during the first few days post-operation.\n\nI know my husband will try to talk me out of this and I will not change my mind. I am doing this 100% and he has no choice but to accept my decision. AITA here?\n        ",

He failed three assignments in a row. In the past, students have been able to redo assignments if they failed them. \n\nI sent an email asking if students could redo failed assignments and the graded assignments be returned today.\n\n\nThe response from the teacher was:\n\n\n*The math homework page 13-3 will be in his packet today. The other two math pages will go home next week. I go up to the school once a week to trade out the papers I have graded and pick up the new packets to grade. At this time, students will not be allowed to correct any papers for a change of grade.

Also considering students are at the disadvantage of not having in class instruction, would it not be beneficial to encourage the students to revisit assignments where it is clear they did not understand the content?* \n\n*District alerts also state homework will be returned the next week, not two weeks later. As it pertains to math, it is imperative to have returned homework as soon as possible. Math builds on previous concepts. If there is a delay in receiving that feedback, it puts your students further behind because they don\u2019t know which concepts they have mastered and which they haven\u2019t. Therefore, it\u2019s likely they will continue to make similar mistakes until they receive feedback, which you are delaying.*\n\n*According to a district alert received on March 30, 2020 from (principal) \u201cThe teachers will be grading the work this week and posting the grades in the Gradebook, then returning the graded assignments with next week\u2019s assignments.\u201d *\n\n*I don\u2019t quite understand why the procedure laid out in the district alert isn\u2019t being followed.*\n        ",

I have a good job now, but still pay 20% of my salary to debt.\n\nMy company has a great PSP, and it allows me to take a loan against it at a much lower interest rate. I recently hit the number needed to pay off the majority of my loans if I borrow against it. In a call, I offhand told my mother I planned to do this.\n\nA week later, my mother called me, and told me that she didn't want me taking that loan because she thought \"The way it works is that they take all interest generated on your retirement fund until you pay back the loan.\" I told her I didn't think it worked that way, but she launched into her \"offer\". She told me that she was willing to loan me the money herself, with similar interest rates, on the condition that my parents wanted to work with me to make sure I was budgeting correctly.\n\nI was concerned about this--these sorts of financial issues can lead to lots of rancor, and I've been burned in the past by allowing them to much access and then being nagged about my failings--but in their defense, I had poor financial control and probably deserved it.\n\nRegardless, I agreed to sit down with my mother and go through my budget for the last couple of months to see \"what I could afford\" to pay back every month. We did, I didn't hold anything back, and every time my mother saw something she didn't like she'd get a little testy and go \"That's too much on dumb video games\" or whatever. I said that I knew I wasn't perfect, and what I hoped to get out of this arraignment was someone to keep me accountable and cheerlead for me. I told them I'd make a budget on Google Sheets to track my progress.\n\nShe mentioned that \"Well, it's totally possible for you to just hide stuff from us.\" I told her that if she didn't trust me to not do that, then she shouldn't offer this sort of thing in the first place. After we went through the debts I had and added them all up, it was about 10% higher than the figure I'd offhand quoted to her in our first conversation.\n\nWhen I called her next morning, she launched into an immediate tirade about all the things I'd done wrong over the last year, and told me I could \"snowball\" the different loans and it'd all be paid off very quickly. She then told me I had failed at not adding more debt to my situation, and finally finished by saying she wasn't going to loan me any money at all, because the additional money was \"too much\" and they'd rather just not help at all if they couldn't pay everything off at once.\n\nI told her that I wasn't super concerned about her not loaning me any money and she kept talking about all the ways I'd messed up over the last three months. Finally I sort of realized what was going on here, and told her that I thought she'd manipulated me into revealing all my issues with a false promise of trying to \"help me out\" when in reality they just wanted to pry, and hung up.\n\nAITA?\n        ",

We have been dating for about two years and id say im close to his family. Ive gone on hikes with them,been to other family events, played boardgames with them, etc, etc without any hiccups. We are both 20. \n\nAnyway, at the Christmas eve party, we were both invited to play blackjack with the generous uncle and a several cousins. I didnt have any cash on me, and there was a 20 buck fee to join the game. Lucky, my boyfriend's mom prepared: she gave both me and my boyfriend both 20 bucks. I thanked her and began playing. I ended up winning 100 bucks! I was so happy! I made an agreement with my boyfriend at the party to spend all the money on his christmas presents. I did not offer to repay the mother the 20 bucks. In my mind, it was a simple gesture that she had planned for. She didnt mention repaying her while giving me the money and she didnt ask for the money after blackjack. \n\nAfter poker, my bf and i talked to a cousin that played blackjack. She asked why i dont wear make up and jewelery extremely condescendingly. I got a very strong message she was judging and insulting me for my choice to not wear make up or jewelry. I was a little offended, but i brushed it off. Whatever. Its almost christmas!\n\nOn christmas day i find out that my boyfriend's mom, her sister (my boyfriends aunt), and the sisters kids (my boyfriends cousins) were as my bf puts it \"talking about me.\" I asked over text message what they were discussing about me. \n\nThe mom was mad i didnt offer to repay the money. Another cousin was mad that i won and didnt instantly return the money to the uncle. Her reasoning was that \"the money was meant for the family.\" The condescending make up cousin sided with the previous cousin. \n\nTbh, this isnt the first time the mom has gossiped about me. But this time it really grinded my gears. I was already a little mad that the cousin was making fun of me for not wearing make up. And now another cousin was mad at me because i won a few games of blackjack?\n\nThe day after christmas i confronted the mom. I asked her if i had lost all the money in blackjack, would she expect me to pay her back? She said idk. I took that answer and gave her 20 bucks from my winnings. I then instructed her to give the remaining 80 bucks of the winning to the cousin who was so concerned about the money being in the family. If the cousin didnt want it, then i instructed to give it to the uncle. If the uncle didnt want it, i said to throw it away because i dont want it.\n\nThe mom now says i was rude to her. She is demanding an apology. I do feel a little sad about being abrupt with her but my friends say i was just standing up for myself and i need to clearly show her its not cool to ridicule me in private What do you think? AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nHi everyone. Thank you so much for responding. I was just confused on how to handle this situation and everyone has been so helpful. I realized after reading a few comments that both me and the mom messed up. We were both childish and immature in this situation. Today (the 29th) my bf and i went over to his house. I wanted to apologize. After realizing the mom wasnt home, we left. I intended to return back to the house to apologize later. A few hours after visiting her house, the mom called my bf and told him that she doesnt want me in her house anymore. What should i do, internet judges. I feel like she is now being unreasonable. The boyfriend later texted his mom that i just came to apologize, but she hasnt responded yet.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for causing a problem at a wedding | Let me start by saying that I can be a little insecure. I often feel that my girlfriend could leave me or doesn't love me. Even though she can't wait to get engaged and are about to buy our first home together after 2.5 years of being in a relationship.\n\nSo Saturday we went to a wedding, where my partner was a bridesmaid. She looked fantastic. And there were one or two people there she had had very insignificant relationships with. A few texts, plans for a date, or even a kiss. But no serious ex boyfriends or anything like that.\n\nSo anytime she spoke to someone, I did my best to remind myself that she loves me and she would never hurt me and that I am good enough. The night went off with no drama. No comments from me. I was being my usual loving happy engaging person.\n\nThen at the end of the night, after drinking most of the day, I walk off away from my girlfriend to do something, but then realise I need to ask her something, so came back in about 30 seconds. Within that time, a boy she had previously kissed, had approached her and had his hands cupped around her face, holding her face close to his.\n\nWhat I did next created a sequence of events. I walked over to them,  he let her go, and I cupped my hands around his face, as he had done her, and asked him if he was ok. That is it.\n\nHe then asked me to go outside to fight him, instantly jumping to let's fight. I walked away from him with my girlfriend, but he stalked us across the dancefloor and kept saying let's go.\n\nSo rightly or wrongly, I said lets go outside. I had no intention of fighting him  but felt the need to remove this situation from inside the venue to outside, away from everyone.\n\nWe went outside, stood separately in crowds, whilst my girlfriend stood near me in floods of tears. This went on for a few minutes, until he walked over and asked her was she ok. My girlfriends friend asked me to go away, to keep me and the boy separate. I was completely shocked that i was being asked to leave. I asked my partner should I go and she nodded. Leaving me alone, while the other boy was in a group including my partner and her friends. The boy had known them all for 20 years.\n\nThis literally broke my heart in two.\n\nI feel frustrated I started this, but feel that he overreacted and that my girlfriend did not have my back.\n\nI don't really have many friends so need someone to help me understand if I am completely in the wrong or if I am right to feel disappointed in my partner and also that the boy was clearly a complete psychopath.\n\nTL; DR - I grabbed a boy and caused a scene at a wedding and feel awful\n\nEdit: also, the morning after the wedding he messaged her saying she looked amazing and that she should leave me because I'm a dick. She's very non confrontational so hasn't replied, even though I suggested we send him a selfie of us saying how happy we were.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for insisting that my boyfriend not use the fluorescent kitchen light? | My boyfriend and I hardly fight but we're at a standstill over the big fluorescent light in the kitchen of our 1BR apartment, and I'd like some arbitration. I'll try and lay it out as objectively as I can.\n\nMy side: I know it's weird, but I hate overhead lighting, fluorescent in particular. I feel like hate is not even a strong enough word. When that kitchen light is on it causes fight-or-flight in me. I want to get away from it, but it's permeating everything. If I go in the bedroom and close the door I can see it coming through the cracks and it feels like it's seeping into my brain. The only analogy I can think of is a stink bomb. I become anxious and unhappy until it goes away. Sure I have to deal with fluorescent at work during the day, but I'm anxious enough outside the house. I don't want to live that way in my home at night. I'm happy to buy and maintain as many table and floor lamps are necessary to produce adequate light. I know I'm not the one who cooks, but honestly if it were a choice between the light or takeout, I'd prefer the latter. I think my boyfriend should accept my preference and not use that light while I'm home. If I lived alone it would go completely unused, I have no issue doing the dishes or using the kitchen with just the other lights we have. I think it's unreasonable of him to subject me to this discomfort.\n\nHis side: he does the cooking and most of the dish-washing (I work full time and he doesn't, and that's part of our division of labor.) He cannot see as well when the overhead light is off. Aside from that, he enjoys the lights. Any more table lamps in the kitchen would not be feasible. If he were living alone he would not use any other light for the kitchen/living room area, he'd leave it on all the time. He thinks it's unreasonable of me to insist that he cook and clean \"in the dark.\"\n\nSo what do you think? Who's the asshole here?\n\nEDIT/INFO: I could totally deal with this by spending time in the bedroom while he cooks/cleans. It would be fine for me if he used the light while I was not in the living room/kitchen. But if I go to the bedroom and close the door when I get home he says I'm being silly and gets sad that I'm not spending time with him, then I say \"well it's because the scary light is on\" and he makes faces at me. But that stuff is more for a relationships sub. I just wanted to clarify I am ok with him using it while I'm home, just not while I'm in that half of the home.\n\nFINAL EDIT: yes, I have a myriad of mental health issues and no joke an entire medical team that I work with to help me be functional enough to contribute to society. I'll certainly bring this up with them, it just seemed relatively minor compared to everything else I deal with. But all the YTAs make it clear I was missing something, so I concede.

She has no skills.\n\nBefore coming to visit she talked about getting a place with a friend. She told me that fell through because the friend would not respond. Two days after she arrived, she ignored a call from her friend saying \"that's 8 times...\"\n\nI knew it would not be easy having my mom around, but she has made my life incredibly difficult. She refuses to do anything for herself. That includes looking stuff up, but also driving places, doing the dishes, taking out the trash, and picking up after herself.\n\nShe constantly ignores what I say, like the fact that I'm in a diet. I pay for everything, and I generally dont mind. However, she complains about how much everything costs, but then in the next breath suggests we do something expensive. I've been slowly getting angrier and yelling some.\n\nHer birthday is coming up, so I offered to take her to a comedy club and get her a cooking class that she had expressed interest in. She then responded that she thought I was taking her to a casino. (Backstory is that my mom has a gambling problem and I have told her repeatedly including that morning that I would NOT take her to the casino but that she could go herself.) At the point I had had enough and lost my cool. I told her that I was in the verge of kicking her out but that I did not want to. I explained that I cannot get any space from her, physically emotionally or mentally. She didn't really respond. I gave her until the morning and said we would talk then.\n\nThe next morning she said she would try to give me space. I responded that I was sorry I lost my cool and that I didn't want to be a person who kicked her out. I told her she could stay until the end of June and I would not threaten her to be kicked out again with 2 exceptions.

I make the lattes most of the time, and I always wipe the tip down with a wet towel when I\u2019m done. I can always tell when my wife makes a latte, however, because she never wipes the wand down, and it\u2019s left covered with dried or even burnt milk.

I unscrewed it, held it between two fingers, shoved it in front of her face, and threw it in the sink. Fast forward a few hours and my wife notices the tip is missing and asks me where it is. I explain what I just said to her, and she concludes that she must have thrown it in the garbage when she emptied the sink drain strainer. \n\nThis turned into a big argument over who had to dig through the garbage bag to find it. My wife said it was my fault because I\u2019m the one who put it in the sink and that there was no way she would have known it was there (she also tried to claim she wasn\u2019t washing dishes - she was merely sorting ones to go in the dishwasher and ones to be hand washed).

Two guys who I get along with very well, and one girl who is becoming an increasingly bad roommate (in our eyes). We'll call her Sandy. \n\nFor the first few months things had been great, bills paid evenly and on time, chores evenly distributed, etc. However, over the last 3-4 months, Sandy has been falling behind on the utility bills for the household. Our agreement is that one of the male roommates has all of the utilities in his name, and we pay him back 1/4 of the total of all the bills each month. In total, Sandy owes $309 in past utilities, which I and the other two male roommates assume will not be paid, and will only continue to grow each month until she moves out.\n\nPresently, my male roommates and I decided that if she is going to make zero effort to pay the money she owes (which is the case, she finds money to buy and take care of animals, booze money, etc but will not pay off the $309) that we would cut her off of our WiFi access. We changed the SSID and password, shared it between the three of us, and that was that.\n\nA day later Sandy is instantly angry about the Wi-Fi situation. She has no mobile data (cannot afford it), so our Wi-Fi is her only internet access that isn't public. Immediately after yelling about how she deserves internet access, she went and pulled the plug on the router. We plugged it back in, 20 minutes later she did the same thing. We plugged it back in again. Since then that has stopped, but still. That alone is a pretty childish gesture in my eyes. I don't believe she really has any right to the utilities in our house if she is making absolutely no effort to pay for them. Why should the other two roommates and I pay for Sandy to sit in an air conditioned room on her phone all day? \n\nTLDR: One of my four roommates has not payed utility bills in 3 months, and we expect her to not pay that debt or any additional debt in the future. In response we changed the WiFi so she cannot use it.\n\nAITA for keeping the internet access open for only those in my house who pay for it?\n\nEdit: hey guys, just wanted to fill in a little more information for context on Sandy.

I bring my tattoo kit and everything. This girl, 19 years old sits down and says she wants \"HARRY STYLES\" Written in gothic letters across her chest. I say I'm not good in calligraphy but I could design something that reminds her of Harry styles. She says no, and says that she really wants to get Harry's name tattooed.\n\nI try to decline but she gives me the equivalent of a hundred dollar bill and says she'll write it and I can do the rest. Given the fact I'm broke and I really needed the money, I accepted. \n\nWhen she's finished I explain that since this is her hand writing, any imperfections are her own doing and she must understand that I'm not responsible for the design. She accepts and we get started. Halfway through she starts complaining about small details, the stencil gets faint, and it's really hard for me to keep focusing. \n\n3/4 through, she said she wanted a brake and went to the bathroom, when she came out she was crying and quickly left the party.\n\nIt was a really shitty tattoo, and I feel like I've scarred this girl for life, most people tell me it was her decision and that I warned her, but I really feel like I shouldn'tve done it. Would it be ethically wrong for me to spend that money?\n\nI already decided I'm gonna stop tattooing for a while until I get a proper apprenticeship and I know what I'm doing, but I can't help but feel that I've ruined someones life already\n        ",

There's a bathroom, kitchen, living room, 2 \"bedrooms\" and an attic. I am putting the quotes around bedrooms because that's how they were marketed, however we don't use the advertised bedrooms as bedrooms.\n\nMy boyfriend is a personal trainer and I teach dance so one \"bedroom\" is a home gym. And we're not talking hand-weights here, but big, huge, heavy machines like treadmills that had to be put up after getting them through the door, as well as a pole that is bolted into the ceiling and floor right in the middle of the room. We both use this room for at least an hour or two a day and due to having different routines our workout times rarely overlap.\n\nThe other bedroom is an office for both of us. We have separate desks, separate stacks of files, and need space because we both regularly have to take work calls or video calls with clients, and sometimes my clients even come to the house, and I see them in the office.\n\nThe third \"bedroom\" referenced in the title is the attic. When we bought the place we realised we needed the space so we did up the attic into a functional bedroom in order to have the gym and office spaces.\n\nMy sister lived with her boyfriend until last night, when she found out he was cheating on her. Other sister lives in a studio flat, and our parents passed away, so that leaves me as the only person who can take her in. She called me, in tears, begging for a place to sleep, saying it'll only be until she finds a new place. I talked to my boyfriend and we said she could stay here. The sofa isn't a sofa-bed or anything, just a regular old fabric sofa, so I got my sister a blanket and pillow. She looked a bit confused but I was tired and just sort of said \"help yourself to food, goodnight\".\n\nThis morning she asks why she slept on the sofa as opposed to one of the \"spare rooms\". I tell her the rooms aren't spare. She then asks what's in them and I show her. She then asks if we can't move a desk or a treadmill to make way for her to put up a blow up mattress. I told her that wasn't really feasible. She asked to just try and I gave a firm no because I'm not about to mess with what is essentially work equipment.\n\nShe's now making a fuss, saying that she's going through a tough time rn and I'm not being as empathetic as I probably could be. She's apparently told our sister, who agrees that we could just get rid of 1 desk or move a treadmill just until she moves out, but we don't want to. It's our place, we like our little system, and we don't want to completely upend it, even for a sister in need. It has been pointed out that we could use a spare room for these sort of occasions, but we're planning on getting an extension built for this exact reason, but we only moved in last October, so we're nowhere near ready to sort that out yet.\n\nAITA for not wanting to move stuff around for my sister?\n        ",

We split them weird, but I feel like we both pull our weight. We both work from home, we both clean, she\u2019ll manage finances, I\u2019ll do laundry, etc. We don\u2019t currently have a car, nor do we have good public transit, so my mother\u2019s boyfriend ends up picking me up from the house when we need stuff from the store. My wife finds him creepy (for good reason) so she won\u2019t ride in a car with him.\n\nA frequent argument, however, is my forgetfulness.\n\nI honestly try my best when I go, but there are times I forget stuff. For a while she\u2019s been accusing me of only picking up things we need for myself and my kid, and \u201cconveniently\u201d leaving her out. Most of the time I just brush off her complaints as paranoia, because I\u2019m genuinely not meaning to forget stuff. \n\nToday I noticed that we got our tax return back, my daughter went off to school, so I decided to ask my mom\u2019s boyfriend for a ride to the store to grab a few things we needed. I got a new keyboard and mouse for the computer I use for work/gaming, and a pair of headphones as the last pair we had broke. I also saw a cute stuffed dog and some dinosaur truck toys I knew my daughter would love, so I got them to surprise her and came home.\n\nWife wakes up from her nap, and she\u2019s not happy. She\u2019s livid that I spent money without her divvying up what needs to be spent on what, but I really didn\u2019t spend that much, so she calms down.. But then, immediately asks me if I got the charger for her tablet. \u201cYou know, the charger I\u2019ve been complaining about for the past week because my old one broke and I need my tablet for work?? Something YOU told me to stop complaining about several times because YOU claimed you were well aware I needed one and would grab it once we got the money?\u201d She just kept going on and on about it, and I left the room. \n\nShe claims that whenever I forget stuff, it\u2019s always stuff for her. She\u2019s a picky eater, so we don\u2019t really like the same foods, and sometimes I do end up getting stuff I know I\u2019ll eat or I know our kid will eat, but she\u2019s picky so I don\u2019t really know what to get her most times. When I do laundry, I\u2019m usually just worried about getting clean clothes for our daughter to wear, and might forget to throw things in for her. Sometimes I\u2019ll forget tampons and stuff, but I just have a really shitty memory, and even times I\u2019ve brought lists I still end up forgetting stuff. \n\nThis probably wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if we had easy transportation, but it\u2019s not as simple as just hopping in the car and going back. I literally have to either be lucky and catch my ride when he\u2019s not busy, or schedule something. \n\nHer argument is that I\u2019m not thinking of her, and she claims that \u201cafter six years you should know what I eat or know to throw clothes in the wash for her\u201d, blahblah. Basically, I think she\u2019s being too sensitive, she thinks I\u2019m being inconsiderate. Who knows,  maybe I\u2019m wrong. AITA Reddit?\n\nEdit: Ok guys wow. The fight my wife and I have had has since passed, I was just curious about if I were being insensitive and I think by now it\u2019s clear I have been. But holy, this thread is more heated than the initial fight, calm down. I\u2019m not going to go into our personal financial situation, or every sordid detail of our personal lives just for a fair verdict here because it\u2019s pretty obvious at this point that there\u2019s no such thing.\n\nMy wife isn\u2019t lazy. She works more than I do, she handles most of the stuff to do with our daughter when it comes to doctors and teachers and stuff. She\u2019s pretty hard working and stresses herself out a lot to the point where sometimes she does become sensitive about things and it\u2019s hard for me to navigate what I should take seriously, and I\u2019ll admit I am lazy brained. What I thought was just an overreaction to my forgetfulness is probably seen as me never thinking of her. I can work on it, damn.\n\nThe amount of people claiming I don\u2019t love my wife, or that she should just do everything herself are making so many speculations you\u2019re making flat earthers and antivax moms look sane. Calm the fuck down, I\u2019ll do better to communicate with her and look into some home delivery stuff.\n        ",

About a month after we get together, her dad gets diagnosed with cancer. \n\n\nI have no frame of reference for dealing with sick people. I have never met her dad, and we are newly dating. About 5 months in, her dad gets pretty sick. During that time, she asks me if I want to meet her dad, and I tell her no, because I think it's way too soon. \n\n\nWe're together for 6 and a half months when her dad dies. Naturally, she's a wreck. She's looking to me for support, but we've only been together for a short period of time. I don't want to help her plan a funeral and talk to family members I've member met before. \n\n\nI told her that I'll check in on her while she's planning, but I won't stay with her or help her plan. I also remind her that she has lots of friends who have known her longer than me who are really supportive. She says she is disappointed, but understands, and is fine as long as I come to the funeral. \n\n\nThe day of the funeral comes, and, I just can't do it. I'm in my car, in my suit, and I just can't go in. My phone is blowing up from texts from her, texts from our friends, phone calls, and I just can't do it. I wind up not showing up. \n\n\nWe talk later that night. She is really upset and says she can't believe she had to go through the whole event without my support and worrying about where I was the whole time. I felt bad, but reminded her again that we haven't been together for that long, and she had her brother and friends there. \n\n\nShe calls me an asshole and tells me she needs time to think. It's been about a week now and I haven't heard from her. I think both of these decisions are rash. I don't think I'm an asshole, I just think I'm young and don't know how to deal with death. \n\n\nSo tell me, AITA?\n\n\nEdited: Ok, I guess the verdict is out, I'm an asshole. I still disagree, but I'll accept my judgement. For all those calling me vermin, or wishing the end of my relationship, I hope you develop the empathy you're telling me I clearly lack and realize that people can make the wrong decision when they are under stress and faced with a situation they have never dealt with before. She has a lot more friends and social support that me, and is better at dealing with things in general. It's part of the reason why I like her so much.\n        ",

I had her as the result of an affair between me and a colleague at the time. I was stupid and immature and got involved with a married man which I cringe at now. But when I was pregnant he begged me to get rid of it but I didn\u2019t. He ended up having to come clean to his wife and they quickly moved to the other side of the country to get away from me.

When I told the student this, she immediately started crying. I was quite shocked, as she's usually quite calm, collected and just a confident student overall. She ran out of the room, and I sent her friend after her to calm her down. Later, I sat her down and talked to her about what was upsetting her. The poor girl was offering to do the detention but was pleading that I wouldn't email her parents. Her reasons were very scattered and did not make any sense, but from little snippets of what she was telling me, I could tell that there was some sort of domestic abuse going on at home.\n\nI am an Asian woman, and I have also experienced this type of violence at home from when I was growing up. While it was painful and unfair, I do believe that the aggression did not come from a place of hate and is a common disciplinary method for Asians. I also could not imagine someone taking my parents away for them beating me, because although I hated it, I truly felt like my parents loved me and we have good relations to this day. They are definitely not narcissists.\n\nThis girl is from the same country as me, so I suspect that what she is going through at home is also a cultural, disciplinary thing. However, I don't want to take any chances with a topic as sensitive as this, especially since she was driven to the point of tears from the mere thought of her parents hearing about her detention. I am at a total loss for what to do. On the one hand, I could give her a secret detention, but that would not be following school policy. On the other hand, I could email her parents about the issue, which would probably result in violence at home. Or, I could not give her any punishment at all, which I feel is too lenient. WIBTA? I hope to get lots of different perspectives.\n\nEDIT: I was asking for advice on whether I should send an email home for the child, but yes, I have informed my supervisor. I do not live in the United States, and I live in a country where corporal punishment at home is not illegal. My supervisor has arranged for the student to meet with the school counsellor to work through what she's facing, but legally, there is nothing we can do. Please stop telling me I deserve to lose my job, it genuinely hurts.\n\nEDIT II: We have not emailed the student's parents, nor have we given her a detention. Instead, we've decided to call them in to talk about the situation that happened and clear the air. After talking to the child again, she was much calmer and told me that she cried because she couldn't handle the workload and that she didn't want her parents to be disappointed in her. When I asked her if any sort of violence was happening at home, she denied it with a very straight face. It could be a lie, which is why we've called in the parents to make sure that there is not abusive behaviour. We've also decided to cut down on homework for the whole class.\n\nAlso, fuck off. I am not justifying abuse, and maybe I worded it wrong when I said 'abuse' in my original post rather than 'corporal punishment'. I meant that, from my own experiences, I could not imagine authorities taking my parents away because they beat me. A lot of you don't seem to fucking understand that no-one in the school could give less of a shit about this due to the fact that it's very common - no-one is helping me because they don't think it's a serious issue. As well as this, not punishing this student is controversial in my school because the school head assumes that this happens to everyone.\n        ",

And he got kind of stubborn, saying he was just paying me a compliment. By this point, everyone was staring.\n\nI was feeling pretty mad and I realized it would be a better call to walk away rather than escalate. So I said \"excuse me, I'm going to take a walk before I say something I'll regret.\" And I went and grabbed my shoes and purse and went for a walk.\n\nI'd already been having a really bad week before this, my best friend moved out of town and I missed her a lot, my apartment had been partially flooded by a plumbing issue, I was exhausted from the long drive the night before. And this thing, that should have been a little annoyance, was like the straw that broke the camel's back for me. \n\nI started crying when I walked. I texted my best friend to tell her I missed her. She called me right away and could tell I was upset, and we talked for a while as I wandered. Talking to her made me feel a lot better, and after catching up for about 20 minutes, I noticed my phone was dying, and I ought to have been getting back, so I said bye.\n\nMy phone died right after we hung up, and I started making my way back to my boyfriend's house.

I told my husband this story from my teaching days and he thinks I am unequivocally the asshole.\n\nAt the beginning of every year, I would give a simple assignment to my students. The project was to choose a disease or illness (the flu, Lyme disease, etc.) and give a five-minute presentation on it using PowerPoint. The purpose of this was mostly to get to know the students individually, and to teach them to use PowerPoint by requiring music, hyperlinks, transition slides, graphs, and a few other things.\n\nI had one student, named \u201cMolly\u201d, who completely shocked me with her presentation. Instead of picking one disease, she picked five (five!) and gave a 20 minute presentation on how these five diseases combined (it was something like rabies, a tapeworm, flesh-eating bacteria, and a few others) could turn someone into a zombie! \n\nIt was very well-researched; she went above and beyond for all five of the diseases, by far the best in the class, and she was intelligent and spoke well, but she didn\u2019t meet any of the requirements in preparing the PowerPoint; she didn\u2019t use any music, or transition slides, or anything else she needed. Going off of the rubric, I had to give her a D, and honestly, I was disturbed by the subject material.\n\nI met with her after class to talk about the grade, and I asked her, did you do this for brownie points? She said no, she got carried away by how much fun she had researching, and she wanted to be a scientist when she grew up. I told her, no one will hire a scientist who can\u2019t follow simple directions, and gave her a chance to redo the project.\n\nShe brought in a new assignment a week later (I don\u2019t remember what she researched) that met all of the requirements, but had none of the vigor of the first. In fact, every assignment she turned in for the rest of the year really only met the bare minimum. I think she ended with a B.\n\nMy husband thinks I crushed her dreams of becoming a scientist.

And I said as much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe got upset and pointed out how even though my brother and I don't live at home anymore, we still get equal say, and that it's not fair. She threw up the basement gym and how a home theatre \"would've been shared more.\" No, it wouldn't've. We have five TVs in that house, and we still fight over the big screen in the living room. Besides, as my brother pointed out, he and I paid half, and Mom and Dad paid half for the remodel, so if anyone shouldn't have gotten a say, it's the person not contributing to the bill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe went on and on. She wanted a little lap dog. We got a Doberman. Well, first of all, any dog is a lap dog if you try hard enough. Second of all, the local ASPCA had just shut down a breeding kennel, so we rescued him instead of paying $600 for one. Third of all, we're not the sort of people a little frou frou dog needs. The need somebody who take them to the groomer and put bows in their hair, not somebody who is going to look a mud puddle and think \"I bet I can get a big splash out of that.\" It ain't fair to the dog.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe don't watch TV with her. Honey, I *tried,* but, let's be real, I have watched every episode of Gossip Girl with you, and I still don't get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently, she has latched onto this idea that she deserves extra votes, and I don't know where it came from. She said we were being \"unfair\" and called me a bitch.\u00a0I called her an \"entitled twat\" and a \"whiny brat.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMom texted me a little bit ago, saying that sis was still mad at me for being a dick, but I don't really feel like one. I mean, I was harsh, but I don't know that I would say I was out-of-line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: It seems to need clarifying, but my sister's first choice for her day was to go to the Met. She was disappointed, and she wanted to go to a Broadway show *in addition to having already went to the museum.* Nobody else was allowed to pick two things on their day.\n        ",

Earns a great salary with almost unlimited career progression. She's very bright and kind. Graduated top of her class.\n\nA few months ago Vicky admitted that she had a crush on  a new colleague. I suggested that if she's comfortable with workplace stuff then she could maybe get to know him first. Unfortunately after a few weeks she convinced him to follow her on instagram, and she followed him to find a girl in nearly all those pictures. I warned her to back off at this point, but she insisted that she would ask him directly if he's single. She did so and he confirmed that this was his girlfriend. She came home from work and started crying. \n\nVicky has always been very pretty, and given that she has a  successful career she's never had any problem getting attention in the past. When she was at school she brought a different boyfriend to our home every week. I don't think she's ever been rejected by a man before. If she has she hasn't mentioned it. She was in floods of tears and said a few unpleasant things about the guys girlfriend, saying why would someone like him date ''a fat girl'' and things like that. All I could do was hug her while she sobbed and tell her that he didn't deserve her anyway and that the right guy will come along eventually.  \n\nShe's still quite down, but my husband doesn't think that I should have told her that the guy didn't deserve her. He chose the other girl. That is true, but it's just about making Vicky feel good about herself. I had to hold her while she sobbed and all I wanted to do was make her feel better.

FFs have 3 kids, who are extremely misbehaved and they're a lot to handle. I'm also sick, so that adds even more difficulty to the situation.\n\nFor the majority of the time I've been here, I've been babysitting the three kids and my siblings by myself while FFs and my parents prepare for the wedding.The kids as I said are very misbehaved, and they prompt the other two to act up as well. They scream, argue, cry, and generally don't listen to me when I tell them to do anything. FFs have a gym set that they're not allowed to climb on, and because they don't listen when I tell them to get off, I have to run back and forth to actually pick them up off the equipment. They get my brother, who has ADHD riled up as well, and then my brother encourages my sister to join in, so I end up having to control five misbehaving children who don't listen to me whatsoever.\n\nWhen FFs came home I explained the situation to them and they said that they would get another babysitter to help me out with the kids when they go out for dinner. I was incredibly thankful. They went out for dinner and CB showed up. The first thing she did was drop her bag in the middle of the living room and sit down on her phone. The kids were going wild as always but this time it was literally happening all around her and she was doing nothing to stop it. This carried on the entire night, and not once did she step in to help. She actually found out that I was sick around halfway through the night because she came upstairs to use the bathroom while I was up there vomiting. I kinda hoped she would start helping me after seeing that I was unwell, but she continued to ignore the chaos going on around her and ultimately left me to do all the work.\n\nNearing the end of the night, I asked CB to help me get the oldest child to go to sleep. He wouldn't listen to me at all. He just screamed at the top of his lungs and threw a tantrum on his bed. She told me she'd be up in a minute and that she was just facetiming her friend real quick. I was angered and I knew she wasn't gonna do anything, so I managed to get him to bed myself.\n\nFFs come home, and talk to CB. They then pay CB $100 for \"babysitting\" their kids, and I got nothing. So before she left, I told them I had actually done everything, and added that she knew I wasn't feeling well but still left all the work up to me. She called me an ass and told me that I only ratted her out because I was \"entitled\" and \"wanted her money.\"  It has some truth to it I guess because I didn't think it'd be fair if I was the one working my ass off but yet got nothing while the one who sat on her ass got paid. They ended up asking the kids the next morning if CB paid attention to them, all of which said no. They apologized to me and called CB's parents to tell them that she was fired. Now I feel at fault.

I was super into photography at the time, and had done lots of shoots with them before for free. As I'd gotten more serious I started watermarking my photos, which had already caused some friction.

The trip itself was an awful experience, but that's another story.

When I confronted her about this, she doubled down, and eventually felt that the \u00a350 I refused to pay settled it. From my perspective, nowhere close.

I am confused and say that I am not so shocked, because he already said yesterday that he isn't sure. She calls me heartless bitch and that she definitly never thought that he would break up. She also claims to have a heart attack. I tell her that she probably has a Panic attack and to take some Deep breaths to calm down. She doesn't listen to it and rants on About how ruthless her now ex boyfriend is until she suddenly hangs up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't really know what to do after that. I didn't contact her to not upset her. She texted me a couple of days later:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer: i am still upset that you haven't apologized yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: i don't really know what to apologize for. I stand by what i said. It was not a sudden shock to you. You knew before that he could break up. He even said that he wasn't sure. But i understand that the timing wasn't right for me to say that. So i apologize for saying that straight away when you were very emotional. I should have talked to you about that at a later point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer: that's not what you did wrong. It was a sudden break up. I didn't know that he would even consider breaking up. I could have never guessed that! Why are you in his side?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: that is just not the truth. When you told me that you are poly you said you were worried how he would react. And when you told him, he said he needs time to think about it. To me it was pretty clear that he could break up with you. And to be honest, i can understand him. Apparently he doesn't want an open relationship and so he rather breaks it up with you than to keep a relationship going that would make both of you unhappy. Maybe it is better that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer: wow. I didn't realise you are such an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, am i the asshole for saying that the breakup wasn't sudden and that i can understand him?\n        ",

My sister and her husband are affluent and make around $300,000 (a very high salary in our area). I am having a difficult time financially and only make $40,000. My sister asked me if I would give her my son\u2019s clothes he had outgrown and his toys he didn\u2019t play with anymore. I had been saving them in case I had another child, but I wanted to help my sister so I gave her all of his clothes and toys. About a month ago, my mom mentioned that I should try selling some of my belongings on Craigslist. She mentioned that my sister had made a good amount of money selling my son\u2019s clothes and toys on Craigslist. I confronted my sister about this, and she said she had only sold \u201cthe stuff they outgrew or didn\u2019t play with.\u201d I asked her in the future to give me the clothes her children outgrow (my son\u2019s clothes only) so I can consign them because I really need the money. My sister said once you give something to someone you should not ask for it back. I then asked her to consider donating my son\u2019s clothes instead of selling them to help other people like I was helping her. She became upset and said once you give a person something it isn\u2019t yours and you have no say in what they do with it. I said, \u201cFair enough. Do what you want with everything I have given you, but don\u2019t ask for any more of my son\u2019s things.\u201d She says I am being selfish for withholding my son\u2019s belongings from my nephews. I know that she and her husband can easily afford to provide my nephews with all of the clothes and toys they could want. AITA for caring about what my sister does with the items I gave her for her children?\n\nUPDATE: First of all, thanks so much for all the replies! I was really so surprised...I didn\u2019t think people would bother reading because it wasn\u2019t something juicy like \u201cAITA for sleeping with my grandma\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d I don\u2019t know if my sister saw this post, but she just texted me and said she was sorry for calling me selfish and she understands she\u2019s not actually entitled to my son\u2019s things. She said it meant a lot that I was willing to give her all of that stuff because she understands I need the money. She even said she will let me have his clothes back after she is done with them. Either she read this post or aliens gave her a brain transplant. Thanks for helping, everyone! My sister can be self-centered and is definitely cheap, but she is a decent person at heart. Maybe she just needed a swift kick in the pants from some kind internet strangers to straighten her out.\n        ",

She graduated a year early from high school. She is kind-hearted and funny. She is beautiful. She is a talented singer and guitar player. Just a wonderful young lady.\n\nEver since she was 15 she has been making money playing and singing around town. She is talented.\n\nHer boyfriend of about a year is a farm hand. He cleans stalls and gets in hay. He wanted to be a fireman but failed the aptitude test for the academy. He works and drinks. He is joining the Navy, but the reserves so he doesn\u2019t get deployed. His family is also fundie Christian. He drinks too much and is a bigot and homophobe.\n\nShe and the current boyfriend broke up because he was getting nudes from another girl.\n\nShe has had one gig in the past year. Singing has not beer a priority. If you want to be a performer, it has to be a passion and she hasn\u2019t shown it.\n\nShe was hurt by the breakup. We were happy that it happened and hoped she would find her focus and expand her world. My wife saw that The Voice has auditions in LA and my brother and his wife live in LA very close to where the auditions are. We encouraged my daughter to sign up to audition. She would have something positive and fun to look forward to. I also wanted to (yet again) expose her to something better than the low-class crowd she is spending her time with.\n\nShe reconciled with the boyfriend a month ago. We just can\u2019t abide homophobia and don\u2019t want to spend time around him.\n\nBuying a plane ticket to LA is a burden for us. I would have to work OT. Now that she is back with the BF I am not inclined to pay for it. She has not worked on her music for a year. I would support her in her music if it was something she was passionate about and putting her energy into. If she works on her music, gets gigs, and starts performing again, I would fly her out next season to audition.\n\nShe works and could buy the ticket herself if it was that important to her, which she has never suggested. She says I am taking this away to punish her for a boyfriend I don\u2019t like. I can\u2019t say she is wrong. \n\nWIBTA to no longer pay for this trip?\n\nEDIT: OK I hear you and I kind of knew you were right all along. It\u2019s sad that some people are so eager to say you\u2019re a bad parent over things like this. Parenting is hard and when you are in the midst of a scenario you don\u2019t have great perspective.\n\nFew points of clarity.  She has been passionate about singing in the past. Not lately though. And over the past year we have watched her orbit get smaller and her interested focused more on her BF and less on singing. We suggested the LA trip to cheer her up after the break up. We don\u2019t push her to sing. If she doesn\u2019t pursue music that\u2019s fine with us.\n\nSo I will buy the plane ticket and hope she has a blast!\n        ",

Our beds are about a metre apart from each other, so there's barely any personal space.\n\nThere's a little problem with one of my roommates (let's call her A). Multiple times she has invited her friends over without telling us, even though we have a groupchat. It's always sudden, and her friends leave extremely late (one time her friends decided to leave at 1:30 am on a Thursday). Since there's pretty much no space in our room, if A invites 4 people, they sit around on our beds, which is annoying. We tried talking to her that this shouldn't be happening, but she acts really selfish and disregards our interests.\n\nNow imagine this. It's Monday. Me and the other 19 year old roommate (let's call her S) leave in the morning, while A decides to sleep in. I return back to our room at about 3pm, A is still in bed and she tells me that she decided not to go to university today. Understandable. I leave the dorm again, go to library to study, and then return at about 7:30. S is already at the room. At 8pm there's knocking on our door, and one of A's friends (let's call her V) comes in. Alright, it's not that late, she can hang out here I guess, it would've been nice for A to let us know that she's inviting V over though. They talk, loudly. For some reason, sitting 30cm apart means that they have to yell at each other. S and I talked recently that we should tell A once again that this shouldn't be happening, but now it would be too awkward to tell her 'Hey, you should be more considerate of us, we never invite anyone over without telling you'. Well, as 9 pm approaches, they decide to start singing. I message S that maybe V will leave soon, since you know, it's Monday and 3 of us have lectures at 9am tomorrow. That doesn't happen. At about 10 pm S and I finish getting ready for bed, are in our pyjamas, skincare done, makeup off, but A and V don't get the hint \u2013 they bring out a guitar. Now A is playing her guitar and V is singing. Anyways, at 10:45 I say \"Hey, it's almost 11pm. Maybe it's enough?\" I'll admit and say that I said it sternly, since I was genuinely pissed off. Well, V giggles and leaves and A decides (probably just to spite me) to play her guitar for another half an hour before she starts getting ready to go to sleep. I was pretty angry considering that she decided to just fuck around the entire day and invite V over late at evening even though she could've hanged out with her during the day.\n\nWell, recently I found out that V is telling everyone in our faculty that I'm hysteric and I screamed at her and made her leave, she just changed the little detail and said that it was 9pm, and not 11. I'm trying my best to look at this from A's and V's perspective but I just can't. I feel like the previous times when she was selfish by letting her friends stay this long clouded my perception.

My older sister is 30 and my brother-in-law is 34 and they both are not living with us. \n\nThis past Christmas, I received a gift from my older sister and BIL. They kept telling me how this was the \"perfect gift\" for me and how it's the \"best gift ever\" so when it came time to open gifts with my family, I eagerly tore into it. It was a brown, checkered blazer. I like blazers and I like how this blazer looked so I thanked my sister and BIL for the gift. \n\nThat evening, after my sister and BIL left, I tried on the blazer and looked at myself in the mirror. The blazer was too long in the sleeves and too wide in the body. In other words, it did not fit me. I asked my parents for their opinion and my dad agreed that it was too big on me, but my mom said I should just shorten the sleeves and it would be fine. \n\nI didn't want to keep a blazer that didn't fit me, so I texted my sister telling her I appreciate the gift, but the blazer doesn't fit and asked for the receipt so I can exchange it for a size that fits me better or return it. My sister tells me in an annoyed tone that she has the receipt but I should just get it altered. \n\nYesterday, I saw my sister and BIL at another family gathering and they told me how the jacket is worth $300 but they bought it at a department store for $30. They also told me that they went to that department store to look for a blazer for my BIL and found this one but it was too small for him so they decided to give it to me instead. I told them I don't want to spend money on alterations and would instead like to exchange or return it. \n\nMy mom and dad are telling me I should keep it and get it tailored since it's a $300 jacket. My sister and BIL are upset that I want to return it, and said if I did return it, to give them the $30 they spent on it back. I sense that everyone thinks it would be rude of me to return the gift.

My husband and I and our kids live in a suburb outside a major city where I grew up, where my little sister lives in an apartment downtown. My little sister (32/F) and I are very close and she comes to hang out at my house with my family  multiple times a week, she eats dinner with us 2-3 time a week. \n\nMy sister and I grew up poor with a single mother who was working three jobs. All we had to eat was junk food, and processed frozen dinners. We couldn\u2019t afford healthy and fresh foods, and mom wasn\u2019t there at dinner time to cook so my sister and basically lived off canned ravioli and frozen dinners. This led to me being a very overweight teenager and I had horrible self esteem. When I was 22, I was sick of feeling bad about myself so I made a lot of drastic changes and it took a while but I finally got myself to a point where I\u2019m now happy with both my body and my diet and have been for a while. \n\nBecause of how hard it was for me to get healthy eating habits, I\u2019ve always been super careful and particular about how I feed my kids. I don\u2019t ban any foods or anything but when we all sit down to eat dinner every day I make sure it\u2019s something healthy, fresh and usually homemade. I spend a lot of time cooking and meal prepping because as a parent this is just something that is important to me. I make sure we always have healthy snacks in the house. \n\nAnyways, last week my husband and I went to California for our anniversary. We had my little sister watch the kids and stay in our house. I left a bunch of already prepped dinners and school lunches in the fridge/freezer.

My sister knows how I feel about food and my kids. \n\nWhen I got back, only one of the prepped dinners I made was gone so I asked my sister what she fed my kids and she was like oh we went out a few times, we got pizza once, I made sandwiches one night, etc because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know know how to cook.\u201d I got really upset because I put a lot of work into the meal prep and she just ignored my babysitting instructions about the one thing she knows I am very particular about when it comes to parenting. \n\nShe said it\u2019s not a big deal that my kids ate unhealthy for one week and she just \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel comfortable\u201d cooking and that she didn\u2019t realize I was going to be so upset and that I\u2019m overreacting .

She came to my wedding wasted and her behavior embarrassed many of my guests. I called my god daughters mom the next morning and got shit from the binge drinking couple for ratting them out.

It is rare to find a parking space even near the entrance. \n\nWe went to the mall tonight and as I was searching I saw an empty space in a close spot but I was one aisle over. I told my wife \u201cgo out and stand in the space and I\u2019ll be right over\u201d. She was hesitant but I told her to do it or else we would lose our opportunity because there were other cars driving down the aisles. She complied. From the time she got out until I got to the other aisle and to the parking space was less than 20 seconds. As I am approaching I see another car hovering near her and my wife is pointing at me as though to say \u201ctalk to him\u201d. \n\nI roll down my window and this man is screaming that I can\u2019t do that, that I can\u2019t reserve a spot by putting a human in the space. I told him to immediately to move and we had an argument. The man also began screaming at my wife.  I began beeping and screaming for him to leave and move out of my way.

The doctor's office quickly ordered another ultrasound to occur roughly 1 month later. The entire purpose of this 2nd ultrasound was to confirm that our daughter did, in fact, have a viable heart and that all 4 chambers of her heart were present and accounted for.\n\nThe day of the second ultrasound, December 21st 2018, we were turned away by the doctor's office because our insurance company had not yet approved the \"prior authorization.\" When I called the insurance company, they diverted responsibility (of course) to a 3rd party prior-authorization processing company called Evicore. Naturally, I called Evicore immediately to inquire about the delay.\n\nEvicore told me that (paraphrasing here), \"it can be difficult to get MD's to review prior authorization's this time of year because of the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.\" I went fucking ballistic.\n\nI said, \"You're going to let my wife and I languish in worry over the Christmas holiday because your MD's are out on holiday with THEIR families?! While your people are enjoying time with their families I have to sit and wonder if my unborn child has a functional heart? Do you have any appreciation for how morally wrong that is?\"\n\nThe 'soccer mom' in me then demanded to speak to someone in leadership.

He then said, \"If it was such an emergency, you could've put a rush on the order and had it handled 3 weeks ago.\" I went ballistic all over again. I said, \"Excuse me. I'm focused on having a healthy child NOT jumping through your hoops. Your company's interest in this scenario is purely financial. You exist to protect the interests of Blue Cross Blue Shield.\"\n\nI told the guy that his job is illegitimate, his company is predatory and his entire professional life has been dedicated to protecting the financial interests of an insurance company that bankrupts the sick and vulnerable.

I thought her phase was over as she would eat everything without a hassle.\n\nOne day Amber told me that Kylie hasn\u2019t been eating at school and throwing up after diner. I was VERY worried of course and immediately got a therapist and a doctors appointment to check her health. \n\nThe doctor said that she had lost a bit of weight but it wasn\u2019t threatening at the moment but she would need it managed and check regularly. She had a therapist appointment 2-3 times a week. Not much came of it and after about a month she was thinner and weaker. It was horrible, I just wanted to help her. \n\nShe fainted at cheer practice and hurt her hip and this was my breaking point, I had to do something.\n\nEvery morning she would make a smoothie, like with stuff like berries and vegetables in an attempted to be \u2018healthy\u2019 So I decided to order 5 kg of weight gain formula that\u2019s used for muscle growth. Every morning I would make her these \u2018healthy smoothies\u2019, and she never questioned it. \n\nThe doctor was pleased by her weight gain, I had told him about the formula he said it was fine as it was helping and keeping her from a risk bmi. Everything was going great. Thankfully she was making process with the therapist and each day she was improving more, during this time she was rarely able to do cheer which motivated her get healthy.\n\nOne morning I was careless and left the bag on the bench before rushing to work, I thought it would be fine as Kylie rarely ever goes in the kitchen and she had to leave to go to school so anyways. I was wrong and she found the bag. \n\nShe refused to talk to me for two days, and I was scared she would get sick again. Her therapist asked to speak to me after their session and she practically told me I was a asshole, not in those words obviously. That I had betrayed her trust and set back months of process because of my actions. \n\nI don\u2019t feel bad though, I did what I needed to help her and she\u2019s in a better place now than she would be without it.

My Mom confessed this to my Dad who was obviously traumatised. My Dad has had some big issues with gambling in the past and my Mom tried to use that against him to flip the situation.

Our premature princess was born at \\~28 weeks, and went straight into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where she currently still is.  \n\nThe delivery process itself wasn't smooth either, as we were trying to stall the progression while the corticosteroid injection helped baby's lungs to mature more before delivery, and we opted for a C-section as the ObGyn suggested this was the less risky option for the baby to be delivered safely without complications.  Unfortunately, my wife's epidural chose the C-section time to stop working, and she had to be put under general anesthesia, which meant she was unconscious and I wasn't allowed to be in the OR when our daughter was born.  \n\nMy wife also said afterwards that although she couldn't move and didn't feel pain, she was actually aware ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia\\_awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia_awareness)) during the procedure and could hear the conversations being had.  We also had another unfortunate complication in that her post-op recovery wasn't normal, as one of her legs temporarily lost function and wasn't able to move as well as the other after the surgery.  This required a one-week hospital stay to gradually gain enough function back that she could mobilize safely on her own, then another 4 weeks-ish before she was back to \\~90% normal function, and only in the last 2 weeks has she been more or less independent in movement with enough endurance to be able to drive herself to the hospital to visit our daughter in NICU.  Prior to this, she would have to wait until I was off work before we would go together to the hospital. \n\nOther relevant background info is relating to my work situation.  Being a family doctor, I have a relatively stable/flexible occupation in my workplaces.  The clinics have patients who do rely on me for their well-being, but no one is critically ill, and I have colleagues who could cover me in a pinch, or the patients can have patience (my usual line when I'm running behind during the workday), and wait until I was back at work later on.  I also teach medical school students in small-group sessions, so have scheduled teaching sessions where they would have to find a back-up tutor if I cancel on short notice, or they would need to reschedule those students.  Lastly, the aesthetics clinics I work at definitely have clients who expect I be there on their scheduled appointment availabilities, otherwise they might just go elsewhere for their Botox/filler needs, and not come back to the clinic again.  I'm extremely unlikely to be fired from any of these jobs for taking a certain amount of time off on short notice, but the longer I take off, the greater the impact on the job itself as well as others relying on me being present.\n\nCurrently, our daughter has progressed reasonably well in NICU, with only a few minor hiccups/obstacles here and there, but is otherwise healthy and on track for a late January discharge, which we are very thankful for.  Needless to say, the last 2 months have been the most stressful time of my life, which is saying a lot given my occupation/training.  Despite the hecticness, I haven't missed a day seeing our daughter in the NICU, and on most days spend at least 3 hours there, and up to 6-7 hours on the days where I don't have work.  The NICU nurses are excellent and provide 24/7 care (makes me extra appreciative to have the Canadian healthcare system, otherwise I'd be close to bankrupt by now probably), which means that when we go, we help out with some tasks like diaper changes and feeding, to build some normalcy in the situation, but even if we aren't there these tasks are done by the nurses.\n\nOne of the additional difficulties with this kind of situation is that being at the NICU means I have less time outside of work hours to complete tasks, which includes completing patient charts/records in a timely fashion, completing invoices for the aesthetics clinic owners that I work on a revenue split for (I'm now 3 months behind, meaning I haven't been paid for that work yet, technically), buying/assembling furniture and other baby needs to get ready for baby's arrival back home, etc.  There's a host of other things that also need to be done, including an ethics/legal complaint related to the hospital stay, and other complex shit that happened while my wife was in hospital, but all that would likely be another Reddit post later when I have time for it.  Additionally, due to the stress of everything, recreation time that usually helps me cope with stress also comes at a premium.\n\n  \n**TL;DR -** Premature daughter in neonatal ICU following C-section 3 months before anticipated, with maternal complications including intraoperative anesthesia awareness and leg neuropathy requiring \\~1.5 months for functional recovery.  Daily visits to NICU means less time for other responsibilities, including work-related and life-related tasks, as well as impact on stress coping recreational activities.  Occupation as a family doctor means job stability/flexibility, but impact on others if I'm not at work.  \n\n\n**AITA questions**:\n\n1) My wife was frustrated with me for returning to work earlier than she wanted me to.  I took 95% of the week off during the time she was in hospital, spending essentially the entire day to be in hospital with her to aid in her mobility/ambulation/activities of daily living, and slept on the pull-out couch in her room every night.  I went to 1 teaching session that kept me off-site for \\~4 hours, as it was too short notice to reschedule easily.  The week after my wife was discharged and at home with an easier time completing daily functions, I went back to work at \\~75% capacity in the 1st week after discharge, and then back to full-time by the 2nd week after discharge.  \n\n**AITA** for going back to work at this pace, given the circumstances?  Finances aren't an issue with savings, but the opportunity cost is also high for not going to work.\n\n\n2) My wife feels that I don't want to spend as much time at the NICU as she does with our daughter, and puts pressure/guilt on me for this.  I admit that I have a different perspective than she does on the situation, in that I know even if we're not there, our daughter is safe and cared for by the NICU nurses.  As such, I do want to go every day to see our daughter and bond, but at this stage, it doesn't make sense for us to spend 8+ hours there, basically doing most of the NICU nurses jobs for them.  My wife tried this initially as soon as she was able to get to the hospital on her own, and it exhausted her physically/mentally, to the point that I had to convince her she needed to scale back to the 3-4 hours we had usually been spending there.  I recognize that caring for a child IS a 24/7 job, which will be about a 70/30 split on responsibilities when our daughter comes home, since my wife will be at home with mat leave from her job as well as taking the semester off from her school program, while I continue to go to work.  However, the situation is still different slightly, as whenever babies nap, that's time that the parents are supposed to nap/complete chores/tasks, which in our situation isn't the case since we're at the NICU, not at home.  \n\n**AITA** for wanting to just go to the NICU for a few hours a day, so that the rest of the available time can be spent catching up on everything else in life that needs to be done before our daughter comes home, thus freeing more time to spend bonding with her once she is back?\n\n\n3) My wife is also frustrated at me for taking more recreational time/opportunities that she thinks is needed, given the circumstances.  At the end of a workday, I did feel the desire to unwind a bit, either by watching something, browsing Reddit of course, or gaming.  Yes, I know I could not do this, but I'm not sure how my stress levels would be if I didn't.  I also am relatively social, and would hang out with friends once or twice a week on average (used to be 4-5 times a week when I used to be single).  We would usually just play card/board games and grab a bite, and I wouldn't ever get drunk or anything.  Since the birth, I've only gone out 2-3 times to hang for a few hours with them on weekends, certainly less than I did before (luckily they know and understand the situation)\n\n**AITA** for including de-stressing recreation time as part of the schedule, which does delay some of the other tasks, and how much is appropriate?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the read, apologies again for the long post, and grateful for the honest opinions to give me some perspective.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited: formatting for easier readability.\n        ",

He's a weird guy in general (I've known him forever, he's never been giving; ie, tipping 5% when we go out, asking to split the check with his girlfriends on their birthdays, etc). I should also say that he is semi-employed, sets his own hours, and works from home. Anyway, I ask him how fatherhood is treating him, and he said great.\n\nI said, isn't it hard to get sleep with a newborn? And he said \"my wife deals with night time. I sleep through the night.\" Another friend asked him what that meant -- he said \"I need to sleep because I have work.\" And I said \"but don't most dads help out at night?\" and he said \"I can't. I need to be rested for work\" -- at this point, all the dads --- who have full time jobs, unlike my friend -- are laughing and saying things like \"yeah, so do I.

So basically I've known this guy (lets call andre) for about a year. Durring that time he has asked me out in one form or another 3 times. Now our friendship is far from perfect just about every other month we get into an argument and we dont talk for a few weeks. Becasue of this I dont really like him, as a friend or as a potential boyfriend. Hes close freinds with all of my other friends so it's hard for me to just never talk to him or see him again. Another unrelated bit, andre was telling me about some girl in his art class who he had a crush on so I assumed he was over me.\n\nNow for the story. So I was on the phone with andre talking about how my ex had just broken up with me and I'm kinda sad about it but we were better as friends anyway. Then I look at and see I got DM from him that says knock knock . At this point I'm confused why is he DMed me while we were talking so I asked him why he couldn't just talk to me. He says just respond I want to tell you a joke. So I complied said who's there and he texts doya I say doya who and he says do you want to go out with me. \nI thought he was joking so I just said no. If i knew he was serious i would have told him no in a nicer way. When I found out he was serious I was very upset. I got dumped the day prior  and I've told this guy I dont want to date him for the 4th time now. After I go on my little \"are you fucking serious\" rant he tells me that my other friend told him that he should ask me out, which I immediately call bullshit on because that friend doesnt even know my ex and I broke up. Then andre starts begging me to not tell anyone because they'll make fun of him. I told him I hand to go and hung up. \n\nWas this an asshole thing to do? Should I have been more sensitive?\n\n\nEdit: since everyone is asking why I was on the phone with him when I dont like him I'll explain. He called me out of the blue asking for help with his chemistry home work and he asked if I had a partner for the project. I told him I'd help him with his homework and my partner was (ex's name). Then he said something along the lines of \"oh your still with him you could do so much better\" which made me tear up becasue my ex had broken up with me 3 hours prior.

It's her first job of any kind and she makes $5/hour.\n\nI thought it would be a good exercise to teach her about taxes and fiscal responsibility if I charged her $1 for every $5 she earns. I pay for everything for her - her education, food, clothes, extracurricular activities, etc. This isn't about her paying me back though, it's just to teach her a general life lesson. She has no real need for the money anyways, maybe once in a blue moon she'll go to a movie with her friends or get some lunch for example.\n\nI said that the $1 for every $5 is her \"rent\" that she will pay to me at the end of each week. Well the end of the week came, and she broke down crying as I tried to take $12 from her (she babysat for 12 hours that week). I felt bad, but also wanted to stick to the decision I made and am hopeful that she will ultimately take something away from the experience. She refused to give me the \"rent\" so I went into her room and took it from her piggy bank. I explained how the IRS does the same thing in real life but isn't so nice about it, and that this is a learning experience.\n\nShe broke down into hysterics and my wife started crying as well. My wife has since calmed down since I helped to comfort her, but my daughter will not talk to me. I am starting to question my tactic, but also think it will instill bad habits if I reward her crying when I am trying to teach a lesson.\n\nAITA for charging my daughter $12 in rent?\n\nINFO: My wife does not work, and I also have a 10 year old son. So currently I am supporting four people by myself. I am hoping to encourage my daughter to \"chip in\" (even though as of now it's almost nothing) just to instill that value, rather than have her freeloading even though she is earning a salary\n\nEDIT: I appreciate the comments, and people are correct that she is not ready to contribute to the household. I'm going to get her to stop babysitting since she is clearly not ready to earn a living, and in 2-3 years I may re-instate the program. Thanks for the advice, everyone\n\nEDIT 2: This did not go as expected. I will drop the program entirely after one more month of the arrangement so as to reach a compromise. I agree that she is currently too young to understand, and therefore the program as it stands is not able to fulfill its intended purpose. I will permit my daughter to continue babysitting, on the grounds that she saves the money and pays me a lump sum for rent when she turns 18, as then she will no longer be a minor.\n        ",

It's my responsibility to discipline her and stuff like that, for all intents and purposes I'm her \"father\". So far she has been excellent, her behaviour has vastly improved, her grades are better and she's in a much better place. She has always been a ferocious reader, and for her birthday I bought her a Kindle and set her loose on it. I monitor her internet and computer usage pretty closely (she knows I do this and is mostly ok with it), but I never bothered to check what books she read.\n\nRecently we were talking about her latest reads, and some of the books she was reading were not at all age appropriate. I started going through her Kindle library and removed some other books that I thought were inappropriate, the only ones that really come to memory was a book called 'One Child' by Torey Hayden, there were a few war-related books that didn't seem appropriate for her to be reading quite yet. 'Generation Kill' for instance, I won't let her watch the show or read the book no matter how great they are, some of the language in it is just filthy. All Quiet on the Western Front was another I deleted from her device.\n\nShe has not been appreciative of my actions, but she doesn't seem to be going out of her way to read them behind my back.\n\nI don't have a problem with limiting what she reads and does online, but banning books just feels different. These are well regarded pieces of work, some of which she will probably read as a part of her school curriculum, yet I'm telling her she can't read them. Still, a large part of me feels I'm doing the right thing and making sure she is mature and old enough before reading some pretty heavy stuff. Am I being an asshole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My 13yo sister wants to read some books that are not typically read at such a young age, I think she shouldn't and have banned her from reading them. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Please don't ban me mods, I swear the Big Brother thing was a coincidence.\n\nFinal edit: I don't know if this is standard practice, but I think I want to summarize what I learned. I've been slowly reading all 500 comments, and I was definitely off base with banning most of the books I did. I should've opened up a conversation with her instead of blocking her out. So, the books are unbanned for now. 'One Child' in particular has a very graphic scene in it, and I think I'll make sure I'm fully available for support if she does decide to read it one day, it fucked me up for a bit when I read it.\n\nI'm surprised at the number of people that took offense at me monitoring and blocking her from the internet though, I hope people can understand that the internet and books are different mediums. Just because I'm going to allow her to read whatever books she wants, that doesn't mean she gets to, or should be able to absorb all the self-published filth deep in the depths of the net.\n        ",

Early on in our relationship, my boyfriend and I agreed that since we wanted to spend holidays together, we\u2019d alternate each year between his parents and my parents for Thanksgiving. Both of our sets of parents live within 30 min of us. The first couple years, it went well. Then, out of the blue, his parents told us one year that we would be going to have dinner with their extended family. Cool. Except his extended family lives a 5 hour drive away and they want us all to drive up there and back together. And we would be staying all weekend, Thurs-Sun.\n\nIt was a lot, but it was his year so I agreed. It was mostly great, but his extended family lives in the boonies with no internet access or cell reception. I got back Sunday night to a bunch of angry emails from my boss. I work in a demanding field where the expectation is you pretty much be available 24/7 unless you tell people (and even then it\u2019s frowned upon). I explained that I hadn\u2019t realized I wouldn\u2019t have any access, accepted the reprimand, and moved on.\n\nThe problem is, for some reason, his parents now insist on doing this every year. According to my boyfriend they have always hosted thanksgiving at their house, but now they\u2019ve decided his extended family will host every year.   So every other year, I am expected to take the car ride over with the family and spend the whole weekend there. I\u2019ve done it twice and it\u2019s always pretty inconvenient.\n\nIt\u2019s his year again, but I\u2019ve found out that I have been invited to go to a work conference shortly after thanksgiving this year. Because of prep, timing, and travel arrangements, I\u2019ll need to fly out the night after thanksgiving. I told my boyfriend and offered to still come up there, but leave early by myself. He got upset. Apparently his family will find this incredibly rude.\n\nThis led to a fight where I finally said that I don\u2019t want to go to his extended family every other year. He argued that I\u2019d agreed to it and it was only fair, but I feel that this is way more than I agreed to and is unreasonable. We spend half a day with my family on my years and only have to travel an hour round trip. We spend 4 days with his family and travel 10 hours round trip to somewhere that\u2019s so isolated, I can\u2019t even respond to a work emergency, which makes me look bad.\n\nI told him I wasn\u2019t willing to do it anymore if his parents insist on going to extended family\u2019s. At most, I\u2019d be willing to do it every third year, and do the other two years with my family. He thinks this is incredibly unfair, since I previously agreed to split evenly and since it means his parents have to either choose to host every other year (and not go see extended family) or only see him on Thanksgiving every third year.

I said no issue she can come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo then when I'm holding the party Jill and Lisa are at the door and Jill had a huge black lab by her side. I was obviously surprised since Lisa did not mention her dog. Lisa just says \"Yeah sorry this is her guide dog. She wasn't going to bring it initially but our parents made her.\" and then they try to enter my house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not like I hate dogs but I just didn't want a dog in my house. I'v never had a pet and I didn't want to risk it ruining any furniture and I was worried about hair or drool getting everywhere. Also my dad is allergic. I tried to be as nice as possible and said that they couldn't bring the dog inside. Lisa  made into a huge deal and said that I was being ridiculous and it's a well trained dog and they were already here and I was being discriminatory. I don't really think this is fair. My house is not a business. I don't have to let anyone into my house. Jill was really quiet this whole time. The argument was causing a commotion and a few of the other people at the party came up to see what was going on and they took Lisa's side and said I should just let the dog in.

We have expensive stuff in our house but eventually I was  kinda forced into letting it in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLisa was still pissed and her and Jill only ended up spending an hour  before leaving (eating some of my food and causing a huge attraction with the dog before ).

Before I had 4 rabbits one that was 8 years old and we had to put it down. later my mom decided she doesnt want one of my rabbits because it's a male who had brain damage from birth and has lots of issues and has to be cleaned daily. She gave it away and the people killed it in a week they say they didnt do anything wrong but I dont believe it. Then my favorite rabbit died from skin rot, which just happens theres nothing I could have done to prevent it and we put it down because there was no other thing to do she was older as well. \n\nNow present day I'm down to 1 rabbit to my name but we have 3 others. My mom has promised a lady MY rabbit for a photo shoot only for a day but still. We are out of town so no one would be there to keep an eye on my rabbit and this photo is with babies and toddlers who havent a clue how to handle rabbits.

These kids feed our rabbits random shit too so I at least want to be there to monitor the situation. I told my mom this she said I was being dramatic and that she trusted this lady, who I dont know. I told her to use one of her rabbits or my sisters and she claimed they're all my rabbits so why would it matter which one she chooses. This rabbit is the nicest sweetest thing and I would hate to see it stressed and possibly die from this. So now am I the asshole for refusing this lady my rabbit for the photo.

When we first moved to this house we did not have kids and both worked. I did the yard/pool and she maintained the house, and I would help. We would randomly hire a landscaper or house cleaner depending on how busy we were but generally handled much of it on our own. We are about to move.

I love her to death, and we have minimal problems in our relationship. However, yesterday we got into an argument that still hasn't been solved. Usually we're really good about seeing each others POV and working things out peacefully but it seems this time we each are not budging. I think I'm right and she thinks she's right. \n\nLet me start from the beginning. We're both college students and it's Mardi Gras break where were from so theres a lot of partying going on. On Sunday we all met up at our friends' house for a pretty chill night of beer and video games. I hadn't been feeling too good on that day but I shrugged it off because like hell I was going to miss beer and game night. \n\nBy the time everyone was leaving/going to bed, I started to feel really bad. Sore throat, stopped up, the works. I kept my mouth shut because it was already really late and the night was coming to an end. Come the next morning I tell my girlfriend about how bad I'm feeling and how I'm probably just going to stay home. I asked her if she wouldn't mind staying with me due to how bad I'm feeling. Just to get me stuff like cough drops, water, and honestly just to keep me company. I didn't think this was too much to ask as I would do the same for her, and she has never had a problem doing this before (for when I had the flu, or when I had my wisdom teeth removed). \n\nLater that night she tells me she's going to our same friends' house (along with everyone else who was there on Sunday) for another night of partying. I asked her what about me being sick, I thought she was coming to my house. She told me she had been talking to our friends since they woke up about another party and how it was two of our friends' last night in the city before they had to leave for their college town (this pissed me off because they live less than an hour away and come in literally every weekend). So then we got into this huge argument. We were cursing at each other and both saying hurtful stuff (which, in hindsight, definitely was not called for by either side), but I still feel like my base argument has validity. My argument was that she chose to go partying over staying with her sick boyfriend which was fucked up and made me feel like she doesn't care about me, and her argument was that she can do what she wants, I can handle myself, and that it was important she be at that party because it's Mardi Gras and our friends' last day in town.  \n\nThe main reason I'm so fucked up over it is that she made me feel unimportant, kind of like \"yeah you're sick and asked for my help but I'd rather go hang out and have fun.\" Am I an asshole for getting so worked up about this? \n\nTl;dr -  I get sick and ask my girlfriend to stay and take care of me, she thinks that going to a party is more important.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your feedback. I do appreciate it. If you\u2019re going to comment YTA, don\u2019t bother. I understand what I did wasn\u2019t right and am taking full responsibility. I\u2019m disappointed in myself for not seeing it that way. I try my hardest to be a great boyfriend because she deserves it. I guess this time I just needed an outside point of view. I also hate that what I did seemed controlling to y\u2019all, as the last thing I want to be is an abusive boyfriend. I will be more thoughtful in the future.\n        ",

But my mom is just constantly telling me what a waste it is and how we should, 'just go to Vegas and get it over with.'. I've had multiple talks with her about how important her option is to me and how much I want her to be involved. She always just tells me she doesnt want to be and can't because shes ' just not that kind of mom.'.

I've been showing her dresses online that I like and thought she would like recently and every time all she has to say about them is how ridiculous it is that they're that much and how ridiculous I am for getting one. My sister keeps telling me that this is an important thing and if I don't have her there I'll regret it because this is a special moment for us. But, I just finally caved and asked her and she said she will come, but it had to be on her day off.

My thirteen year old daughter (let's call her Kaitlyn) has been playing piano since she was five. My wife and I have always pushed her to be disciplined in her piano practice. She plays piano for an hour and thirty minutes per day.  Unless she is sick or we are traveling away from home, she never misses a day of practice. Keep in mind that we always have her make up the time that she misses. We allow her an amount of leniency by letting her make up the time over a week's interval. Kaitlyn has never protested about her piano routine and we always believed that she enjoyed it. Yesterday, she was invited to a sleepover with her cousin. I told her that she could go and reminded her that she would have to make up her piano time, preferably before the sleepover. To my surprise, Kaitlyn said that she didn't want to and that it was just a day so it didn't matter much. Of course, I put my foot down and said that she couldn't go to the sleepover unless she followed her piano regimen. Surprisingly, my wife sided with Kaitlyn and said that I should let her skip a day, just this once. I said that if we allowed Kaitlyn to miss a day once, she would take advantage of our leniency and continue to skip days. Kaitlyn is now very angry with both of us and I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong in this situation, considering that she's usually such a good kid.\n\nEdit: A lot of you guys have questions about whether Kaitlyn can still enjoy being thirteen. From my view, she can. This summer she has had two sleepovers.\n\nEdit: UPDATE: After reading all of your comments my wife and I had a talk with Kaitlyn. She told us that while she still enjoyed piano and piano competitions, she felt that she could manage her piano practice on her own. She also said that I am trying to make her more Asian than she is (technically she's Afro-Asian), which is something that I never knew she felt. We agreed that she could make the decisions on her piano regimen (provided that she plays around six hours a week) and that she could go to the sleepover with her cousin without making up the piano time.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for leaving out my daughter in my will for not helping out with our autistic son | My husband and I have three children: 24f, 22f, and 18m who has low functioning autism. My husband and I started facing a lot of financial problems because of our business when my two girls were in their teens and as a result we had to work two jobs and take on odd shifts. Our son has to be watched full time and we could not afford to pay for care so we would ask our daughters to look after him after school sometimes. My elder daughter absolutely refused, saying it was not her responsibility to parent our child and she didn\u2019t even like him. She would choose to go hang out with her friends at their houses instead like regular teenagers do I guess. My younger daughter however would always ask us if we needed help and would go the extra mile to help take care of her little brother. They also have more of a bond then he has with the elder sister who says she hates him because he would take up all our attention. I will agree that I did give him more attention while they were growing up but only because he had no friends and me and his dad and sister were all he really had for support. When my elder daughter turned 18 moved out and said she never wanted to talk to us again. However in the past 2 year we\u2019ve started to reconnect with her again.\n\nThe dilemma comes because of an argument my elder and younger daughter got into during thanksgiving about my younger daughter calling my elder one selfish. In the heat of the moment my younger daughter let it spill that my husband and I have completely excluded our elder daughter from our will except for a small token amount. Our business has done great in the past couple years and we have a size-able fortune now. I do not blame my elder daughter for choosing to lead a regular teenager life rather than help out with her brother since you shouldn\u2019t expect that from a child. However, I do not think children should be entitled to their parents money after they are 18 either so I do not feel like I owe her more. Our will is to show gratitude to my younger daughter who sacrificed so much for our family when she didn\u2019t have to. I also know she will take care of our son when\u2019s hes gone. However, my elder daughter is furious and blasting us all over Facebook. So Reddit, AITI here?\n\nEdit: the reason I told my younger about the will was because we all wanted to discuss what would happened to our son in case something happened to me or my husband.\n\nAlso, I do not feel as if leaving my elder daughter out of the will is punishment. I\u2019ve helped pay for her college, taken care of her dog on many occasions, and we\u2019ve had many good times together over the last two years. However, I think my younger daughter went the extra mile to take care of her little brother when she didn\u2019t have to and hence, my husband and I are going the extra mile to show her our gratitude.\n        ",

After he passed, I didn\u2019t speak to my mom for about 5 years; we were never very close & I was angry at her for many reasons. \n\nWhen I was 22, my mom & I reconnected; she cut back on drinking & I thought I should give her another chance. One day when she was over at my house, my best friend\u2019s father called me to inform me my best friend since grade school died unexpectedly. My mom, who hadn\u2019t seen her in years & was never around much in my childhood to even know her well, fell to the floor shrieking hysterically & was inconsolable for hours.

This used to be just a bit annoying but now she has started barging in when my mum is with clients (mum is a mental health adviser) and doesn't understand why my mum won't give her attention/hang out with her. I put my foot down and said that it's getting too much and is getting in the way of my mums work. Grandmother's response is that we treat her horribly and she wants my mum to quit her job. I tell her \"you need to be on time, check your phone or watch for the time. 15 minutes early is fine but an hour isn't! My mum is working.\" She asks \"what do you expect me to do?\" I say \"be on time\" and she then leaves.\n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n        ",

She's never been diagnosed with a mental illness, but only because she's always refused to talk to anyone about it, I asked/ pleaded, but no dice. She had a noticeable anxiety issue when I married her, but being young and dumb, I assumed my unconditional love would fix it. \n\nI was wrong, and her mental health gradually got worse over our marriage, especially after significant life events like a stillborn child. She self-medicated by getting more and more religious.\n\nShe'd always believed in homeschooling and our marriage ended because I realised that it was doing a disservice to our children and wanted them to at least try school - it ended because by that point, homeschooling had become a directive from God for her. \n\nAnyway, after the separation, she spiralled, to the point that I ended up with full custody of our five kids. I've had then fulltime for just over a year. They haven't seen her since as she left the country afterwards and so has never used her supervised access. \n\nScenario:\n\nIn a wide ranging discussion with my two oldest boys (11 and 14), the separation came up and Master 11 said \"I'm glad you got full custody, Mum was cuckoo\", rather sneeringly.\n\nI told him (after telling him not to talk about his Mum in that tone) \"Your Mum has mental health issues, but that's okay, nearly everyone will have a challenge like that in our lives, but the problem was your Mum didn't treat it. There's lots of support that help people with mental health issues to heal and live good lives\"\n\nI feel like TA because I felt like I was trash talking his Mum. I've done my absolute best to avoid that, and this felt like that. \n\nIt felt like my only other option was to shut down the conversation, because trying to deny she has mental health issues wouldn't fly, my children have experienced her behaviour and formed their own opinions. \n\nAnd I was worried that he'll develop a poor attitude towards people with mental health challenges based on his Mum, so I wanted to explain that a) they're reasonably common and b) usually treatable. \n\nSo yeah was ITA?

I waited outside my house but within my properties walls and played and gave love to my dogs. Two are brother and sister, 13 years old German Shepherd X Timber Wolf, and one 8 month old pure breed German Shepherd, he is a very big boy, vet says he\u2019ll probably be around 50+ Kgs fully grown, his name is Grimm. I love all my dogs with a passion, they\u2019re apart of my family and I have extremely good/strong bonds with all 3 of them.\n\nWhen the Uber driver arrive I opened the gate with my remote and the dogs normally sniff the light poles and bushes outside our property and I let them, they\u2019re very obedient and listen when I tell them to go back inside. Lots of people notice how big Grimm is. I got in the car and obviously me and the guy start chatting about how big he is for a young dog. We eventually start talking about other topics.\n\nCloser the the destination he says to me that he double checks with the person rising about certain turns/turn offs, because he doesn\u2019t want to be blamed and fight with the passenger. He makes the comment that he doesn\u2019t want to argue with passengers about going the wrong direction when he\u2019s just following directions that the app gives him. He says that if he had to fight with me or something, he would just come back to my house and steal my dog, specifically Grimm. He didn\u2019t laugh or say it in a way that made it seem he wasn\u2019t serious.\n\nI live in Durban, South Africa, and we have a big problem with Power Breed dogs getting stolen from properties to be used in dog fighting rings, if you don\u2019t believe me, [Read This Article ](https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/kwazulu-natal/alarm-as-nine-alleged-dog-fighting-rings-in-durban-emerge-20133832), and my worst fear is my dogs being stolen to be used in dog fighting rings.\n\nAs soon as i got home l went on the Uber app and complained about the driver and the comments he made.

My Girlfriend thinks it was a bit extreme, my dad understands why I\u2019m reacting this way.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a decent amount of people saying that I'm the asshole for wanting him to loose his job.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not tipping the bartenders? | Happened last week and I\u2019ve been conflicted ever since.\n\nLast week I joined a few friends at a local bar for a trivia night. I very rarely go to bars, but I enjoy trivia and it was a chance to spend some time with friends. Now, after being there a while, I decided to get a drink, so I went up to the bar, ordered my overpriced beer, and paid. Like I said, I don\u2019t go to bars much so I don\u2019t have much sense of common practice. It occurred to me briefly that maybe I should tip but I figured hey, I\u2019m not sitting at the bar, the guy just handed me a bottle, so it wasn\u2019t like a specialty drink that he had to make. I was paying cash for my drinks, I\u2019m a poor college student and I didn\u2019t want to overpay for every drink I order by a dollar or more. I figured I would just leave a tip when I got my last drink before I left. Nbd.\n\nLater in the night, I go back for another drink and get a rum and coke. It\u2019s important to note that I had a different bartender than the first time. Again, paid what it cost and went back to my booth to continue the trivia. Then I go up for a third time and order two drinks, one for me and one for my friend (maybe that makes a difference). Once again I had a different bartender than the first two times. But this time when I paid the bartender took my cash and said, \u201cyou know we work for tips right?\u201d\n\nI was taken aback. I started to mutter something about planning to tip when I left but quickly decided that tip was no longer happening. It left a bad taste in my mouth but I also felt like a shitty person. My thinking is, I planned to tip later, this was the first time tonight this bartender had served me, and I was not sitting at the bar, I just wanted to get my drink so I could go back to trivia. I\u2019m not trying to protest the tipping culture or anything, but if she does \u201cwork for tips,\u201d that\u2019s not my concern. If her paycheck isn\u2019t enough, that\u2019s between her and her employer. I felt like I had every right to tip or not, and being called out like that made me err on the side of not.\n\nObviously I\u2019m not required to tip, but I also don\u2019t go to bars much so maybe I just committed a faux pax. She said six dollars, so I gave her six dollars. So AITA or just na\u00efve?\n\n\n\nEDIT: It seems most think I\u2019m TA. I just want to clarify a few things. First, I know now that if you plan to tip at the end you should open a tab. That\u2019s on me, just inexperience. I will do that next time. My issue was solely with her saying that to me despite the fact that I still had the opportunity to tip her, and I did plan to leave a tip at my table so it could be split amongst all the bartenders and busboys, though I realize she probably didn\u2019t think that. I know she and the other bartenders probably talked and she heard I hadn\u2019t tipped the other times I ordered (again, planned to tip at the end so I could just do a percentage of the total), but IMO talking trash about patrons to your coworkers isn\u2019t exactly generosity-inspiring either.\n\nI think some people think I\u2019m TA because I ultimately didn\u2019t tip, and that affected the other bartenders and workers. I do feel bad about that. If I had a way to tip just them and not her, I would have. IMO however, if she was not capable of just serving me my drinks and being polite about it, she didn\u2019t deserve a gratuity from me. To me that\u2019s the bare minimum effort. In the future, I will open a tab.\n        ",

It was just a girl thing so I wasn't invited, but I dropped her off and picked her up from it. When I got her, she had a small party bag with some small gifts inside from the pregnant girl, one of which was a small bottle of champagne. She showed each of the items to me as I drove us home and told me about some gossip, stories, etc. Anyway, we get home and she unpacks the small bag and gives me the tiny champagne bottle and asks me to put it in our alcohol cabinet (she can't reach it because she's too short).\n\nIt sat there for a few weeks until one day she went out with some friends for the night and I stayed home to watch a football game. I felt like some wine so I get up to look in our cabinet but it's completely empty except for this small bottle of champagne. The game was starting so I didn't want to leave the house just to buy alcohol and I know my fiance doesn't like drinking champagne so I thought why not. It only had 2 standard drinks in it so it didn't get me hammered or anything, just enough to enjoy the first half of the game.\n\nFast forward, she gets back, I'm completely sober and everything's normal. I didn't mention I drank it because I didn't think it was a big deal. I just put it in our normal bin as well so I wasn't trying to hide it or cover up the fact I drank it. I simply didn't think it was worth mentioning that I drank it. The actual argument didn't come until a few weeks later when the baby was actually born. My fiance tells me the news her friend finally gave birth and she asks me to get the tiny bottle down so we can have it. I told her I drank it a few weeks ago and she was livid.\n\nApparently you're only supposed to drink it when the baby comes. I didn't know and told her as such (I've never been to a baby shower so why would I?) but she said there was a little note written on it that said \"Pop me when she pops\" or something like that. I don't remember seeing it and even if I did I had no idea what it meant at the time. So, yeah, she thinks I ruined her \"friend giving birth day\" for her, which I've apologised for but she's not letting it go. Just trying to figure out how much more I should grovel because I'm the AH or at what point I just need to tell her to get over it because I'm not.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust to give more info in response to a prevailing theme I've seen in the comments:\n\nWe don't view things as \"mine\" or \"yours\" - we've been together 8 years now, own a house together, have joint bank accounts, etc. So she isn't upset with me because I drank \"her\" special bottle (she doesn't even like champagne as already stated); she's upset with me because I drank it before I was meant to without knowing.

I saw these kids cutting trees in the front yard as I walked passed them. They were staring at me so I said hi. One girl came up to me and asked if my dogs were having puppies. I said no. One of my dogs get excited when people come near him so he barked. I pulled him back closer to where my feet were to stop him from barking (he barked like two times before stopping). The girl jumped back right away when he started barking and I apologized for his behavior. Note that my dogs were properly leashed and since I knew how he would react towards people, I already had him pulled close to me when we stopped.\n\nThe next day I was walking my dog again. The girl came up to me and told me that my dog scratched her when he barked at her yesterday. She said he scratched her somewhere behind her foot (she was pointing near her heels). I was surprised because I did not know she was even close enough for him to do that. I said \"I'm sorry if he did because I didn't think you were close enough to get scratched.\"  Her and her friends kept staring at me without saying anything (there were a lot of awkward silences). So I asked her if she needed any medicine or anything. She said no. Then I asked her well what can I do? She said I needed to take better care of my dogs. Maybe I shouldn't have said this next part, but I told her that she shouldn't come near other people's dogs. Her and her friends had a shocked look on their faces, like \"wow, did she just say that?\" They were speechless after that. \n\nHer mom came over and started scolding me. She said \"you're 30-something years old and she's only 9 years old. You are not the puppy here.\" The kids around her started laughing hysterically at what the mom said. It was kind of humiliating, to be honest. I said \"I didn't say anything...\" (was going to say \"wrong to her\") before she interrupted me and told me she saw my face/body language. She was clearly over-exaggerating about my body language. Then I told her that I already apologized and even offered to buy medicine if she needed it. She said \"we don't want your money,\" then repeats how she's only 9 years old and how I'm not the puppy here. I didn't know what else to say so I just apologized again and she left. The kids were still laughing this whole time.\n\nI was a bit defensive because I really think that she did not get scratched by my dog.

I do not live with my 15F and 13M siblings, but I have basically parented them for a good amount of their lives. They live with our dad, and our mom lives in the Lower 48. (Edit - parents are divorced)\n\nThis morning, I was scrolling through Instagram, and saw a post from my younger sister, that made me uncomfortable. She was wearing a green flannel with a grey hood, a tank top that looked to be cut into a tube top, and tight-looking ripped jeans. My sister is a little more developed than normal, and she looked a little slutty, I can't lie.\n\nI messaged her, telling her to delete the post, and she didn't respond or see it until around 2 PM, which I assume is when she woke up. She called me, asking why I want her to delete, and I flat out said \"You look like a whore.\" She paused for a second, and then asked me again why. I will admit, I probably didn't use the best words in this argument, but eventually, she did delete it.\n\nI texted our mom about it, and sent her a screenshot of the picture. She says she 100% agrees with me, and she would have done the same. (Edit - While my sister and mom don't have the best relationship, because of past events, my sister has let our mom slowly come back into her life) But, my dad doesn't agree with me at all. He told me to let the parents parent, and that in his opinion, the picture was fine. I found out later on that my sister and my dad talk about every picture she wants to post on Instagram, and if it's appropriate. I'm just shocked that he said yes to this one.\n\nCurrently, our family is 3 - 2, my dad, brother, and sister saying that I greatly overreacted, and me and my mom agreeing that this was needed.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for calling my wife an irresponsible parent? | TLDR at the end.\n\nSo a couple years back, my wife's grandmother gave us some cash ($5000 CAD) as an \"early inheritance\". I have never been comfortable taking cash from people, but we graciously accepted, and later agreed that it should be ear-marked for a second vehicle, probably a truck, as our family is growing, and we both usually work full-time.  That was the plan anyway.\n\nAbout a week ago my wife tells me she is having a hard time keeping up with bills etc. and asks me to pick up the slack.  No problem.  I handle most of the finances and she typically just sends me an agreed upon amount every 2 weeks.  We agree on a new number for the next few months.\n\nSo the other day my wife tells me she is taking the cat for teeth cleaning.  Whatever.  Her pets have always been her responsibility, and I always make sure she understands that her pets are a responsibility in addition to our family, not instead of our family.  I didn't want those responsibilities for myself, so I made sure she understood these are her pets alone before I acquiesced to ownership.\n\nAnyway, in addition to the cleaning, she spent a bunch of money on surgeries for this cat, (tooth extraction, lump removals) and took it from the 5k from her grandma.  I went off on her.  I was not consulted on the expense, and I am really the one footing the bill since I am covering a portion of her financial responsibilities.  I told her \"You have always gotten unnecessary procedures for these pets, and have no grasp on prioritizing your children, or how to be a financially responsible parent.\" She didn't like that very much.\n\nFinancial details are complex, but suffice it to say that day care is expensive.  We have 1 kid in day care, the other is at home with my wife for a couple more months, before she too will require $600/month day care.  Currently we can get by with 1 vehicle as I work nights (a major sacrifice I make for my family), but that could change any time.\n\nTLDR; my wife keeps dumping money into the pets I never wanted to be responsible for.  The surgeries are often precautionary, and arguably not necessary (fat lumps, tooth removal).  I am sick of (arguably)  footing the bill and not being consulted. She is correct in believing that if I was consulted, I'd have said no.\n\nEdit: I would have made a case to the contrary, not said \"no\", as it is not exclusively my call.\n\nEdit 2: some of you folks don't read too well.  I accept that I was an asshole, but get the basic facts right!\n\nUpdate: I showed my wife and she thinks many of you are bat-shit crazy.

I finally told him I had his wallet the entire time and explained how and why it was in my possession. He was totally pissed and called me a jerk for being childish just to prove a point. I told him it wasn't childish and to consider it a lesson learned. He said the only thing he learned was that he can't trust his wife.\n\nSo AITA for trying to teach my husband that he needs to be more responsible with important personal items?\n\nNote: This isn't the first time my husband has left his keys, wallet or phone out in the open. Luckily they've never been stolen before, and again it's usually because I'll remind him to check if he has everything. This is, however, the first time I've taken an item and kept it.\n\nEdit: My husband has his wallet back. My question about being TA is regarding not giving it back immediately.\n        ",

Like really, really late, until the AM's. And apparently me staying up late affects her sleep schedule. She snapped at me this morning for making her tired.

His wife is the \u201cco-owner\u201d but doesn\u2019t have a damn what this company is about and just sits through meetings and nods as if she knows what I\u2019m talking about to him. I think because their company is successful they\u2019re a little over their head and think they can freely break professional boundaries. His wife is useless and doesn\u2019t really contribute anything to the company besides sitting beside her husband looking pretty. Usually I\u2019m annoyed but don\u2019t say anything when she\u2019s there during a meeting. Today was the last straw because as I opened his office door I saw her giving him a shoulder rub. It was enough for me and I said \u201ci want to see you alone and I\u2019m not meeting with you if she\u2019s there\u201d and went home because I was angry. My boss emailed me that he wants a meeting with me tomorrow as soon as I come in. Can I get fired? Was what I did an asshole move or am I justified?\n\nEdit: since I\u2019m apparently the asshole, should I just quit or go in tomorrow to see what he wants??\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWhat a joke of a company. If you thought I was the asshole last time just wait to see who the new asshole is. Today I went in to see what my boss emailed me about. When I walked in the office I found his wife, and 2 HR managers there and asked her where her husband was. She said she was meeting with me instead and asked me to sit down. So basically my boss didn\u2019t respect my wishes from yesterday and decided to not only have his wife in a meeting AGAIN but he also didn\u2019t show up himself. She told me they were letting me go and that the HR manager will walk me to my desk to pick up my stuff and leave. Notice how she thinks she\u2019s too good that she needs another employee to walk me to my desk. Also, how unprofessional is it that she has 2 other employees with her (probably because she\u2019s nervous to have her first one on one meeting). I felt humiliated because she could\u2019ve done this privately. I tried to explain myself but she kept telling me that this was not a negotiation and this was a final decision. So she didn\u2019t let me have a chance and was being a bitch. I couldn\u2019t believe that my bosses wife was firing me and he wasn\u2019t even here or didn\u2019t care to see me on my last day at work. Every time I tried to discuss it with her she wouldn\u2019t let me speak and said this was not up for negotiation. When I asked to see my boss his wife told me \u201cI can\u2019t discuss other employees with you\u201d. I gave up. When the HR manager walked me to my desk I tried going to my e-mail to talk to my boss but I realized I had already been locked out of all the company\u2019s network. So I couldn\u2019t even send my coworkers goodbye messages. Honestly what an asshole company. Who\u2019s the asshole now?\n\nUpdate 2: I also want to mention that sometimes her and her husband do things besides the shoulder rubs like touching each other\u2019s legs, hugging, and kissing at work. I know they\u2019re married and all but in a workplace that\u2019s just wrong.\n        ",

I know what my boss is doing is shitty. Why I don\u2019t know is if I would be an asshole for reporting her to HR if she tries to force me to come in when my doctor says I can\u2019t. My boss (I\u2019m a childcare worker) has a history of trying to get people to come in no matter what\u2019s wrong with them. If you have a doctor\u2019s note, they usually cave, but even then they think of it as being your fault and that you were taking a vacation. That being said, this is very much expected in my line of work. It\u2019s not unusual for them to guilt trip or try to get out of you being out. A certain number of people have to be present for a certain number of children, and they don\u2019t really care what condition those people are in. Their motto is \u201cpower through!\u201d \n\nNow, I\u2019m getting my wisdom teeth taken out Thursday. I\u2019ve explained to them that I intend to do whatever the doctor tells me to do, and I\u2019ve explained to them that I\u2019m getting all four removed, and that three are impacted and two have cavities and I\u2019m going to be on hardcore pain meds for awhile afterwards. However, they keep saying things like, \u201cwell I came in after I got mine done\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anyone taking more than a couple days off for their wisdom teeth\u201d. They\u2019ve agreed to Thursday and Friday but are giving me pushback for Monday. I emailed her a note given to me by the doctor that says I\u2019m cleared to return on Tuesday. However, based on my boss\u2019s history, I suspect she may try to make me ignore the doctor\u2019s orders. I won\u2019t do it regardless, because my heath comes first and I don\u2019t give a singular fuck what so and so did when they got their wisdom teeth taken out, but what I want to know is if I would be in the wrong for reporting her to HR, if she does indeed try and force me to ignore the doctor. I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts.\n\nEdit: update you guys as soon as she got the note, she came in to tell me that I won\u2019t have enough time off for my birthday (in May, and I asked off for it last month) and my week long vacation in July (also asked off for it last month), both of which she had initially said would be fine before I put the request in.

Last week her son had an odd growth on his neck and developed a high fever and she rushed him to the children's hospital where she was told he had an infection but it was very treatable but he had to stay in the hospital until the next day. So I picked up her daughter and promised to get her to school the next day and our parents (who live about an hour away from the school) would pick her up because I work midshift later than her school gets out. This meant her school start time is pretty early for me but it was a tough situation so I was fine with it.\n\nI got her daughter to sleep in a sleeping bag in a corner of my apartment when my phone started ringing from her shortly after midnight. Obviously I wasn't feeling like answering that late so i just sent her a text with a pic of her daughter sleeping and said \"she's doing fine and I'll get her to school tommorow.\" Which I did.\n\nA couple days later I talked to her. Her son was treated fine and discharged from the hospital. She had to stay with him overnight in his hospital room and was up for almost all night but fell asleep in a chair near him. Then she had a dream where he died. She woke up and started panicking and crying and called me during that. A nurse heard her and comforted her and calmed her down but that's why she called. She made a comment where she seemed upset I wasn't able to comfort her at that time. \n\nI still think it's weird to be upset about this. I get that a dream like that would be very upsetting, but she's a 32-year old woman, not a child who needs to be comforted over bad dreams once it became obvious it was a dream and her son was sleeping fine in the same room. I was already doing inconvenient things for her. It's good the nurse was able to help her but that was her job. I don't call her or anyone else when I have a bad dream alone in my apartment. AITA over this?\n\nEDIT: OK this blew up. So let me emphasize that I do care about my sister and nephew as well as my niece, but it was REALLY inconvenient for me to pick her up, that doesn't mean i had issues doing it or that i thought twice. I was worried like hell about my nephew too although it turns out his infection was never life threatening (and he's perfectly fine now.) Also my apartment is a tiny studio, I literally had to rearrange some record boxes to give my niece a place to sleep, so yeah having a phone convo might've woken her. But I do get now why my sister was so upset and I should apologize. She still seemed grateful for me helping out and just happy my nephew is a healthy typical 3-year old again.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for saying \u201cFuck no\u201d when my flatmates asked my FWB to pay a weekly rent to come see me | So, I\u2019m honestly at a loss with this one and just really need to see if I\u2019m crazy or not. I\u2019ve recently started seeing someone casually for the last two months or so, it\u2019s going really well and will hopefully lead to something more serious. While I\u2019m still figuring out what I want with this relationship, I\u2019m getting pressure from my flatmates to \u2018have the talk\u2019 and \u2018establish what we are\u2019 simply so they can charge him a weekly rent.\n\nHe comes over after 8pm and will either leave when I go to work or have a sleep in and leave later, this probably happens 4 times a week, if that. He\u2019s had 3 showers over the two months, 2 of which were with me. We either get takeout or I\u2019ve eaten and he\u2019s eaten so I\u2019ve only cooked us dinner once or twice in this time span too. So in essence he literally comes and sleeps with me for the night then leaves in the morning, few things in-between. Now keeping this information in mind, would you ask me to get a \u2018weekly or monthly\u2019 rent off of him? This is literally what my flatmates are expecting, him to pay $20 a week to stay with me. They are justifying it by saying \u201cIf you leave in the morning and come back in the evening you are living there\u201d. I find this extremely embarrassing and humiliating behaviour and instantly said there is no ways in hell I am going to ask the guy I\u2019m seeing to pay a fucking weekly rent to come and see me. \n\nIs this normal behaviour? Am I completely delusional for standing my ground on this matter and pretty much saying I\u2019d rather move out than ask him to pay? Reddit, Am I the Arsehole for saying No to this request which has now caused a huge fight within my home?  \n\nFew other things to note \u2013 there are three of us living together, I\u2019m single the other two are a couple. I pay more than 1/3 of the rent too, over $20 more a week to be exact and I never miss any bills or rent payments. I\u2019m extremely clean and always bring a good energy into the house because confrontation is my biggest fear so I avoid it like the plague by being an angel and keeping the peace. \n\nTD;LR My flatmates want my fwb to pay a weekly rent because he leaves in the morning and comes back in the evening 4 times a week, so this means he\u2019s living with us now apparently. I\u2019ve flat-out refused to do such an embarrassing thing and now there is a lot of animosity in the house because of it.\n\nEDIT: I clearly need to add info about the lease agreement, our names and signatures are all on the agreement, they do not own the flat we simply rent it off a landlord. There is no clause about guests, its at our discretion.\n\nEDIT 2: I shouldn't have put 4 nights a week, because that is an exaggeration and each week it is different - I'll stay at his or we'll go away but more often than not it is at least 3 nights at mine.\n\nHoly heck Reddit, never did I think I was the asshole in this situation. I thought it was normal to have the person you're seeing stay over, but clearly 4 times a week is too much. I haven't taken my flatmates feelings into consideration you're all right, I just assumed it was about money for them rather than invasion of space by a stranger.  I am the asshole, thank you all for contributing your opinions I'll be sure to take them on board and have a mature chat with the roommates and sort some sort of arrangement that works for all involved.\n        ",

The latest woman in the line loudly announces that the other woman should go to the drop off to get her refills faster because \"SOME PEOPLE\" don't let \"PEOPLE LIKE THEM\" through the line. She said she usually can get her prescriptions faster that way.\nI ignored the whole interaction, and watched the pharmacist get flustered when she tried to fill at the wrong window. I chalked the whole thing up to a different culture, and assumed I was an asshole in that context (the area was near the Mexican border, whereas I'm in a super white Midwest suburb).\n\nToday, in my hometown, a similar incident occurred. I was in line at Walgreens, and a 70-ish woman asked if I was in line. I told her I was. She sighed loudly and pushed her cart NEXT to me in the line. When I got called up, she acted like she was going to go ahead of me. I glared at her, and continued to the window.\n\nIs this some kind of obvious etiquette? AITA?

Not to the extent where she can\u2019t be in the same room as peanut products, but she has to avoid skin contact and obviously no consumption.

It will feel like 100+ degrees F when we are there this weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday morning, I noticed that our Airbnb did not have air conditioning. I reached out to the host and asked them about window units, and ultimately they were only able to install one, in the living room. I was worried for Annie's health, and I didn't want to stay in that heat, either, so I called Airbnb to see what my recourse was. My intention wasn't necessarily to outright cancel, but to see if maybe they could move us, and what our options would be if they couldn't. After two hours on the phone with them, the only option they gave me was to cancel, and they managed to negotiate with the host to let us cancel with a partial (half) refund - originally, the host wanted to give us nothing. I was on the phone and forced to make a decision, so I accepted and canceled. We each lost about $50 with the cancellation. Had this all been happening over email, I would've texted them and gotten their okay before proceeding, but I had to make the choice over the phone.. so I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hadn't told Annie about any of this because I didn't want to stress her out, but I did tell Mandy. She was of course frustrated that we had lost $50, she agreed that it was the right choice. Then I called Annie. She was livid. She told me that I had no right to make \"decisions about her health and her body\" and that I should've talked to her before doing anything. She didn't let me explain how this had all come about. I told her I had spoke with some friends who would let her stay with them for free, and she said she didn't want to do that. I told her we could book a hotel and Mandy and I would even split the cost if money was the concern, and she said no. She told me she would talk it over with Dan and get back to me on next steps. A few hours later, she texted me and said that I could book a hotel but she would only pay up to a certain amount, and we \"owed her\" for stressing her out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was surprised by how angry she got, but whatever, I figured it was over. Then this morning she texts me and says she needs to tell me how she feels for the sake of our friendship. She sends four very long texts saying that \"unless \\[me\\] and Dan are dead, you don't get to make decisions about me and my family\" and there are f-bombs and saying that I had no right to make any decisions or get other people involved in this situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm flabbergasted at how upset she got last night, and I'm even more flabbergasted by her texts this morning. I've never had a friend speak to me this way, and I feel like she's blown things wayyyyy out of proportion. At this point I have absolutely no interest in being around here, so I'm planning to pay for my part of the hotel but stay with my friends. AITA?\n        ",

She got engaged last September. My boyfriend just proposed to me last week, and now we want to schedule our wedding roughly two weeks before my sister\u2019s wedding date. (We haven\u2019t announced it yet). \n\n**THERE ARE TWO BIG REASONS FOR THIS.** 1) I\u2019m pregnant (surprise) and I\u2019d like to get married before I give birth (Oct). 2) My grandparents are traveling out for my sister\u2019s wedding and staying with us for basically 2.5 weeks. They are super old (90+) and can only make **one** long-distance trip per year from our home country. \n\nSo the reason we\u2019ve chosen that date is because we\u2019d be able to have my grandparents at our wedding as well, since we can\u2019t wait until next year because the baby will be here by then. The issue is the rest of the guests. Most of our extended family still lives around the world and I\u2019m not sure how many would be able to make two international trips within 2 weeks of another. I have a sneaking suspicion that some of my favorite aunts and uncles (and I am their favorite) may choose to attend my wedding over my sister\u2019s. This would cause additional drama. \n\nAITA if we choose to schedule our wedding only 2 weeks before my sister\u2019s. I get that it would take some spotlight away from her. But considering my grandparents\u2019 condition I feel like people would be more understanding of WHY we can\u2019t schedule any other date. AITA?\n\n**EDIT**: lots of people asking why we can\u2019t have it after hers. The grandparents leave the day after her wedding weekend. They are only here for roughly two weeks, ending with her wedding. We could have a party reception instead of a wedding but it would still be the same problem since guests could choose to come to ours instead of hers.\n        ",

Sorry in advance for poor writing, let's cut to the chase -\n\nI'm 23F, and have a great job. Though my office is not very stylish, I enjoy expressing myself through fashion, as it's my hobby. TLDR, I care A LOT about my clothes, and have emotional ties to every article in my closet.\n\nMy Coworker is CW (37F). We started at the same time and have bonded by getting dinner together, etc.\n\nCW has always complimented my sense of style, and NGL, feels good to get praise for it. This last month, I'd gotten rid of a few articles of clothing and had offered them to CW - she liked them.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I remember going back to my desk one day to see CW waiting for me, while also wearing my jacket. Needless to say, I was annoyed that she touched it without asking, and asked for it back. CW got upset and was offended. When I'd told her about it later, she claimed that I'm too Western and that in her culture, she is treating me like a sister. I'm not really into myself or my possessions being touched, and when I had let her know my boundaries, CW had doubled down on how I'm \"Western\".\n\nToday's conversation echoed similar sentiment.\n\n>**(Not verbatim):CW** : \"OP, you have great style, I love your dress with docs!\"**Me**: \"Thanks CW!\"**CW**: \"I notice that you only wear docs.\"**Me**: \"Yeah, I collect them, they make me really happy!\"**CW**: \"What size shoe are you? I'm sure we're the same size, I'd love to have one of your pairs!\"**Me**: \"I'm not planning on getting rid of any of my docs soon, I collect them! I can look out for you on depop.\"**CW**: \"Oh, I meant those ones. Aren't docs hard to break in? I feel like it would be less work to just take the ones that you don't wear off your hands.\"**Me**: \"I'm not planning to get rid of any of them, and if I were, I would want to get money out of it, since I've put money into them.\"**CW**: \"Oh, not what I meant! I would only want a pair of docs if they were given to me as a gift, as they're pricey. Those boots specifically, I can see myself wearing them at some point. You're so western sometimes!\"\n\nThe conversation hit a lull, and I went back to my office and began to think that I am just blowing this out of proportion due to our cultural differences on how we define boundaries. This is why I find this hard - CW and I aren't from the same culture, so maybe she feels like I'm being too Western if I don't understand her. FWIW, I enjoy her presence aside from this, I don't feel respected whenever she does this, but am fearful of ruining our friendship by making her feel like I don't understand her.\n\nHowever, though she is my friend - I'm starting to feel like a sentient mannequin.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I told my friend/Coworker to firmly respect my boundaries and not to feel entitled to my clothes or handle my things without my permission? Am I just being sensitive?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 1:** Hi everyone, thank you for commenting! I will try to reply to as many comments as I can. I realize now that I suck at writing titles, as it should be more like \"WIBTA if I asked my friend to stop acting entitled to my belongings?\" rather than the current title.\n\nI'm getting a lot of comments and messages about the cultures of CW and I - CW is Latina, and I'm Biracial, but pass as Southeast Asian - most notably, I'm first generation and have been born and raised in the US. Reading the comments, I've had the further realization that she uses the term \"Westernized\" as a way to \"other\" me. For context, my office is dominantly Caucasian and male, so I think when she uses the term towards me, it's her way of maybe saying that I'm like everyone else, and am whitewashed due to the environment I have grown up in. I can't really think of any other explanation, especially as I am mostly SouthEAST Asian and she's from South America, which is objectively more West :P \n\nFor what it's worth, I don't really have much of an issue of her wanting to have similar clothes to me, moreso the fact that she seemingly wants my EXACT clothes. For instance, a little after I had gotten a bomber jacket, she had also purchased one. I didn't think it was weird, and actually really liked the one she had picked up! Besides the past month or so, I considered her to be a relatively close friend, this is really just super annoying, as I would like for us to continue being friends.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not wanting to keep driving my friend and her boyfriend to lunch everyday? | Context: Me, a friend (\"John\"), another friend (\"Jane\"), and Jane's boyfriend (\"Bobby\") all go to lunch together almost every day. All of us except for Bobby work in two buildings that share a parking lot. Our offices are about 6 miles away from Bobby's, and Bobby's office is another 5 miles away from the cafe we usually have lunch at.\n\nJohn and I are co-workers while Jane works at the next building. Almost every single day without fail, Jane always messages me asking what our \\[mine and John's\\] plans are for lunch. I would usually respond with, \"We're planning to go to the cafe as usual.\" Jane would then take that as an invite and say, \"Oh, okay! I'll tell Bobby.\"\n\nI drive most of the time because it's usually me who wants to go to the cafe. I'd say 80% of the time I drive, 15% of the time John does, and 5% of the time Jane does. I don't really mind driving John and Jane because it's not like I'm going out of my way to do so as we all have a shared parking lot, but it is such an inconvenience to have to exit the highway just to pickup Bobby. Not to mention the fact that I didn't even invite them for lunch to begin with! Picking Bobby up and dropping him off shaves a good 15-20 minutes from our 1-hour lunch. (If we don't have to pickup Bobby, the travel time from our office to the cafe is 10 minutes.)\n\nNow, I suppose this is the asshole-y part: I was talking to another friend when the subject somehow got brought up about how John, Jane, Bobby, and I always have lunch together. Out of exasperation, I blurted out, \"Yeah, it's getting really tiring having to pick him up and drop him off on a daily basis. He's not even MY boyfriend.\" I said that implying that if I were in Jane's shoes and I'd *constantly* want to have lunch with my boyfriend, then I should be the one to drive and not expect it from somebody else.\n\nAfter a week has passed since my conversation with Anne, it was radio silence from Jane. I guess Anne mentioned my moment of frustration to her. Another week passed and still nothing.\n\nI did say to her \\[Jane\\] once, \"Why can't Bobby just meet us there?\" He's closer to the cafe than we are, and we won't have to exit the highway and spend more time traveling than we have to. She snapped at me and said, \"WHY? He's on the way!\" I dropped it.\n\nIn addition, whenever I would choose to stay in the office for lunch, Jane would coincidentally choose to stay in as well (because she doesn't want to drive) and make Bobby drive to her office. I figured, if she can't be bothered to drive to see her boyfriend everyday, why is that expected of me?\n\nIn hindsight, yes, I probably should've been honest with Jane about how I felt, but she has a history not reacting quite well whenever the tiniest bit of negativity befalls her significant other. I honestly believe that even if she heard it from me (in a more thoughtout way, of course), she'd still be acting the same way. I'm not being an asshole by not wanting to keep chauffeuring them around, am I? Or am I just plain impatient?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit: replaced \"Randy\" for \"Bobby\"\n        ",

My daughter is called Sarah and hers is Becky. They are both very pretty but are polar opposites in terms of personality. Becky is very confident, outgoing, has loads of friends and is a huge party girl. She's also very capable academically and according to Eleanor is top or near the top of most of her classes. Sarah is the opposite. She is a kind and gentle person but is sensitive and at times awkward, with major issues with her confidence. She has a few very close friends rather than being part of a large group. Her academic performance is decent but not exceptional like Becky, but we are nevertheless proud of her because we know she works hard at school. \n\nBecky bullies Sarah and has done for a long time. She is spoiled by her parents who think that it's ''just harmless kid stuff''. Just this weekend she told Sarah that she was too ugly to go the wedding and that she would have to stay out of the photos. She also tried to push her out of big family photo at the reception. My wife Diane had to find Sarah after she ran outside crying. This bullying has gone on for years and nobody has made an attempt to stop it. \n\nSunday morning in the garden we heard someone scream inside the house. We ran into the kitchen to find Becky feeling around the kitchens trying to find her glasses. She has very bad eyesight, bad enough that according Eleanor she needs to feel around for her glasses on her bedside table since everything is a blur for her. She has worn glasses in a high prescription since she was a baby. \nBecky was crying her eyes out until Diane found her glasses in one of the food cupboards. Once she had got them back on she started saying that Sarah took her glasses. \n\nI called Sarah downstairs and she admitted that she did take the glasses. We were all disappointed but Eleanor and Paul proceeded to tear into her about how cruel and nasty she was and how frightened and upset Becky was because of her. \n\nSarah tried to explain that Becky had been taunting her about the photos and had been saying that she would be cropped out, but Becky's parents had no sympathy and said that maybe a ''bully'' like Sarah deserves that. I went ballistic and said that Becky had been bullying Sarah for years and they have laughed it off. Paul tried to say that Becky's ''girly teasing'' wasn't bullying and that what Sarah did was. \n\nI can see why Eleanor wants Sarah punished, but at the same time her daughter was the instigator and I don't agree with her wanting to punish our daughter after hers inflicted years of psychological abuse on her. We don't want to punishing Sarah. Obviously it was wrong to take the glasses, but it was a response to years of torment.\n\nAITA?\n        ",

The next day my best friend messaged me reminding me of her birthday dinner this weekend. I said I didn\u2019t know she was going through with the dinner and I already said yes to going with girlfriend to her friend\u2019s wedding, so I can\u2019t go to best friend\u2019s dinner. \n\nBest friend said she never said it was postponed so why did I assume that she wasn\u2019t going through with it.

I said I\u2019m sorry I assumed wrong but again I already said yes to girlfriend.\n\nBest friend said she gets it and to have fun at the wedding. I said thanks and promised to make it up to her and our other friends. But later that night she messaged me and said she\u2019s been thinking about it the whole night and she tried to understand but she can\u2019t get over the fact that I chose a girl I\u2019ve been dating for a month over people I\u2019ve been friends with for years. \n\nI told her I\u2019m not choosing girlfriend over them, it\u2019s just that girlfriend invited me to a finalized event first.

They're both eight and it was a tough decision.

Bring her in, get it cleaned, antibiotic, more glue and she\u2019s good. \n\nWe bring her home and put a recovery suit on her, as the vet said it would help protect her. For a few days she was super chill and loved cuddling the boyfriend and I. Come time to wash her recovery suit, we put her in a onesie until they were clean. Take a nap, wake up and check on her. She wiggled out of her onesie and licked it open this time. Bring her in, gets cleaned up, staples and glue put on this time, and another antibiotic. \n\nDecided that wasn\u2019t happening again and started hand washing the recovery suits after taking them off and putting a clean one on. She couldn\u2019t get them off, so should be good! She\u2019s chill again for a few days. Go to sleep and wake up, check on her and her belly is wet. Check her belly and she chewed open the staples. Bring her in AGAIN, another set of staples and less glue. The inside is closed, just the outside skin hasn\u2019t been able to heal. Talk of possibly needing a revision surgery if she doesn\u2019t chill out and stay away from it. \n\nShe is now wearing a cone full time, and now that she is starting to feel better and her infection is clearing up, she wants to play.

It happened with ours, mostly because she had 5 bridesmaids, and IDGAF who was in mine, as long as I had my best man there. She has 2 brothers and no sisters.\n\nShe did not ask future SIL to be in the wedding party, despite them being engaged. I, at the time, told her this would bite her on the ass.\n\nSo. Basically, it goes like this. Wife doesn't Like future SIL. SIL knows this. BIL knows this. I know this. My wife denies it. I call her on it. I know how she talks about the girl behind her back. And truth be told, my wife isn't wrong in what she says, but that doesn't mean she is nice about it.\n\nFor the past few months, my wife has been mentioning to me things about being a bridesmaid, how she will be mad if she isn't, blah blah blah. My response has been about the same. \"You don't like her. She knows you don't like her. She isn't going to ask you to be a bridesmaid. Because you. don't. like. her. She won't want someone there who can't be supportive, even if its going to be her future sister in law.\" Invariably, she retorts with the \" But I'm (groom's name) sister! I have to be in it.\"\n\nWell, today the list came out. Guess what? My wife isn't in the wedding party. Neither am I, but whatever. I'm not super close with the guy, and he was only in mine cause my wife wanted it that way and I didn't have enough close guy friends to fill out the party. My wife is crying, and I'm rolling my eyes. I can't understand how the fuck she expected to be in the wedding party with her relationship with the to be bride. I can't understand how this is at all unexpected.\n\nThe cincher is that her other brother is the groom's best man, and she says she feels that groom picked her brother over her.

If I'm the ass for confronting her directly, please by all means, give me the Y-T-A. But if its solely about the shut up, I have no intention of actually saying that to her. End edit 1.\n\nEdit 2: I got home from work. As expected she was upset. Crying on and off. She talked for awhile and eventually I started to say some of the things I wrote here. \"Siblings aren't automatically included. She wants you dress shopping and making a speech. You two don't have any actual relationship\" she... got pissed. Like really pissed. She pushed the desk she was at hard enough to knock over a monitor on it, then yelled at me that I never support her and that I should have more empathy. I took a deep breath or two, said \"I understand that you're upset\" and ended up going outside to fix some shit on the house since it's not too bad outside.

I have a 2 year old grandson with hair that grows insanely fast. His hair was past his shoulders when he got his first haircut at 4 months old. My daughter is super picky about hair. She pretty much refuses to try out new hairstylists unless necessary and once she finds one she likes won't see anyone else.\n\n\nWell his hair was starting to get pretty long and messy because he hadn't had a haircut in a while, she said she didn't have the money at the moment but would get it cut when she did anytime I mentioned it. I asked if I could take him to get it cut, and she said only if I use his stylist. It's at this one kids place and after tip the haircuts are nearly $30. I said I didn't want to spend that much on a 2 year olds hair and that I'd take him to the place I usually go.\n\n\nShe refused to let me take him if it wasn't hers, so I dropped it. A bit later, we watched him while she was sick, and she had a prescription she asked if we could grab for her. I figured to pass the time waiting for the medicine I'd go get the him a haircut. I took him to my stylist, since they only charge like $10 for kids.\n\n\nWell she wasn't used to cutting childrens hair. She had a hard time cutting it with him moving around so much, and ended up just doing the best she could. It wasn't horrible, but it was fairly choppy and uneven. There was no way she was going to be able to fix it though because he kept pulling away and trying to push the scissors away.\n\n\nAnyways, when we took him back home she freaked out the second she saw him asking what the hell we did to her child's hair. I told her I took him to get his hair cut, and she said that this is EXACTLY why she said not to in the first place, now her sons hair is all screwed up and they cut it too short to even be able to take him to get it properly fixed elsewhere without shaving it all off. She was nearly in tears over it. I told her I was simply trying to help out because his hair was getting too long and messy, but she didn't want to hear it. Every time I saw her or talked to her after that, she would make a comment about how awful his poor hair looked and she sure hoped it hurried and grew out so she could get it cut properly. \n\n\nShe did get it cut later on, and even during that haircut she was telling the stylist about how I didn't listen to her last time and let someone screw his hair up. Well she just told me \"just so you know, when this is over with, you are NOT getting his hair cut. He can wait until I can take him, even if it's a month or so after I have this baby.\" \n\n\nI thought it wasn't a big deal, but she's still mad, her husband actually seemed upset about it, and my wife got mad at me too, and the hairstylist laughed at me and said \"yeah, grandpa lost his privileges to take him for haircuts with that screw up!\" when they were talking about it.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for making fun of my girlfriend during her worst menstrual cycle? |   \n\nThe events of mentioned in this post took place yesterday; however, my girlfriend still isn\u2019t conversing with me.\n\nI have been with my girlfriend for about 4 years now, and we have been on several vacations and dates, as any other couple would do so. With her moving in, we are having a blast and we\u2019re making the best of quarantine together to make memories. Prior to such transition, the talks of moving in had been on the table; nonetheless, we preferred to nurture our relationship before making a decision.\n\nShe comes from a wealthy family, and she has a French background that makes her inclined towards a \u201cproper lady\u201d persona. Naturally, she was taught to use cutlery from a fairly young age, and I have learned a couple of table manners, all thanks to her. I think it\u2019s wonderful to know how to use knife and fork to relish a meal, she hasn\u2019t steered from her ways\u2014even when she lets loose while she is drunk or partying. \n\nAnyway, my girlfriend\u2019s cycle is sort of out of loop. She normally doesn\u2019t experience cramps but when she does, she stays in bed all day, going as far as taking a day off from her work. As a result, she starts demanding for chocolates (strictly gourmet, not the cheap ones), hot chocolate drinks, junk food. \n\nWhile she is at it, she sorts of steer away from her proper lady persona and succumbs to munching on edibles. It\u2019s extremely unlikely of her to engage in such activities but, whatever makes her happy and relaxed. \n\nShe started with her periods yesterday and was unable to move from our bed. I volunteered to prepare a mix of fruits, oats, and yogurt for her, which is something that she really enjoys. Unable to move her arm and back, I had to help her sit down, straighten her back, and put thermal cushions behind her lower back to help ease the pain. She was demanding for an ibuprofen to help with the cramps but, I urged that she shouldn\u2019t take a pill with an empty stomach. \n\nAs soon as she lifted the spoon to feed herself, she dropped some of the edibles on her plush blanket that she was seeking comfort in. I had never seen her in such improper state, so I resorted to laughing to express my hilarity of the situation. Yogurt was dripping from her mouth, and she dropped a blueberry or two on the blanket and top. \n\nI shouldn\u2019t have laughed at her situation but, I couldn\u2019t help it\u2014since I had never seen her in such improper state, as she is so perfect and sophisticated at all times. I thought it was a comical moment that I should have recorded. I saw tears brimming in her eyes, and she demanded me to get out of our bedroom, which I retorted, obviously. \n\nI discussed the matter with my close friends, and they called me a moronic asshole for making fun for her in such vulnerable state. I don\u2019t think that I was in the wrong to laugh at her. Making fun of your significant other in a healthy relationship is invaluable but, it seemed to valueless to her.\n        ",

He goes on and on about how shes not actually gay, and how its because she was actually just hurt too much.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for upsetting my wife because I refused to let her sister and her nieces stay with me? | Some context. My wife and I are currently long distance as I\u2019m on a 3 month long work assignment in LA. My firm has put me in a fairly spacious serviced apartment for these months.\n\nA few weeks ago my SIL (wife\u2019s younger sister) was sending messages in our extended family group chat about how her and her family might be in California on vacation. They were chatting to each other about what to do and see. At one point she mentioned me and asked about how big my place was. My wife chimed in to say my place is gorgeous and huge. I agreed that it\u2019s pretty big and if they need to stay with me then they\u2019re welcome to, just let me know the dates. Word for word, she responds with \u201cok sure we\u2019ll think about it after we get our itinerary sorted out. Thanks.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s it. Nothing else from then on. Over the next few weeks they chat about what they\u2019re going to see in the other parts of the state to others in the chat. Then they\u2019re in California and sending pics. Normal stuff, but nothing addressed to me (after what\u2019s happened I\u2019ve checked and rechecked).\n\nThen this past week out of nowhere I get a call from my wife. She says her sister and her fam will be over in roughly an hour, they just flew down from SF. I tell her no one called me or told me anything, that I\u2019m leaving for a business trip from Thursday-Monday and I don\u2019t feel comfortable having her sister, her husband, and their three kids in my space unsupervised.\n\nMy wife gets really upset and tells me to get over it, that she\u2019s not going to call her sister and tell them they have no place to stay, esp when they have kids in tow. I\u2019m mad at this point that no one thought to ask me. I told her that\u2019s really not my problem and if they showed up on my doorstep then I\u2019m not letting them in. \n\nThis whole thing has now blown up. They ended up getting some cheap hotel near the airport and they\u2019re pissed beyond belief because they claim I \u201cpromised\u201d them a place to stay. My wife has publicly called me out in front of her whole family, I guess to distance herself and put all the blame on me. Yesterday I found out I\u2019ve been booted from that family chat and my wife has been ignoring all my calls as well. \n\nWITA for being this uncompromising in my stance to not let them stay with me? I felt really justified at the time but now I wonder if I overdid things and should\u2019ve just let them stay with me. It wouldn\u2019t have been a huge hassle but I guess I just felt disrespected by the lack of communication. At the very least I could have avoided all this.\n\n**edit:** to answer some questions I didn\u2019t want to leave them alone at my place bc I have some extremely expensive equipment around my apartment (I\u2019m a photojournalist) and the open layout means there aren\u2019t that many places I could safely store them in for long periods. But if I had been given prior notice, I could\u2019ve either 1) postponed my business trip, 2) made arrangements to move my things, or 3) made arrangements to get them another free place under my firm\u2019s contract with the building. \n\nI also keep a lot of general work in the place (papers, books, etc) that I would\u2019ve needed to tidy but would have had no chance to. \n\nSecondly, I had initially offered to let them stay the first night (I was leaving 1.5 days later) on the stipulation that they would need to find another place to stay when I left, no exceptions. This was immediately shot down as wife basically told me to fuck off. That I can\u2019t expect their whole family to repack their things and move after less than two days (tbh this made sense to me, would\u2019ve been pointless to come for only 2 nights). \n\nFinally, I\u2019ve tried making my case but they\u2019re intent on claiming I should\u2019ve known about my SIL\u2019s plans. Honestly there was a pretty high chance I wasn\u2019t even going to be in town. I don\u2019t know what they would\u2019ve done then. But they\u2019re all pointing to the one text my SIL sent about \u201cletting me know\u201d and saying that was evidence enough that I should\u2019ve expected them at some point. \n\nMy wife is being unreasonable but she\u2019s always like this when it comes to her family. She\u2019s extremely eager to please them and stresses out if she feels like I\u2019m not giving all that I can bc she thinks it\u2019s embarrassing that her husband isn\u2019t being generous with her family.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not wanting to pay my share of the bills? | So about 8 weeks ago I major jaw realignment surgery and my housemates seemed uncomfortable about the possibility of my mum staying to care for me, but I was also getting snide comments like 'Is someone coming to stay with you because you know we cant look after you right? Like we both work so we obviously can't.\"\n\nA couple days before surgery they made a big deal about needing to talk and they kept saying things like \"Yeah look its fine I know you need her to stay but like its a small space for 4 people you know?\" and \"We want you to feel comfortable in your own flat I mean you pay the rent to but its just a small space\". I basically had to promise my mum wouldnt leave my bedroom for them to feel comfortable about it.. Keep in mind its a 3 bedroom flat with a decent sized living area and one of my housemates has her boyfriend over every weekend but apparently he doesnt make the flat seem any smaller?\n\nThe following day (the day before my surgery), I accidentally left the balcony doors open because I was so stressed out, I also had a job interview and an important meeting that day, that I just forgot when I rushed out of the flat (keep in mind we're above street level in a very safe neighbourhood and it was the middle of the day). I then recieved a barrage of abusive messages from one of housemates about it saying that its her shit that'll get stolen and shes sick of me leaving the doors unlocked (its happened maybe a handful of times the entire year I've lived here), she continued to cuss me out despite me taking responsbility and apologising for the mistake.\n\nBecause of all of this my mum didnt feel comfortable staying there. After I left hospital 4 days later my mum still felt uncomfortable staying there (as did I) so my parents scraped together what they could to get us a cheap airbnb for a week. I stayed at a friends house for a week following that, then self quarantined for 3 days at the flat so I could drive 6 hours back to my parents house and stay there for a week and a half. When I returned from my parents I was invited to stay at the same friends house for 2 weeks as my housemates had caused more drama while I was gone. They were also disregarding the current warnings, continuing to party and go to large social gatherings with friends and were refusing to wash their hands. (Im also a fairly severe asthmatic so I was worried) Overall I have only really been at my flat for about 2 weeks total since my surgery.\n\nToday the quarterly electricity bill came in, its all based on usage and I asked if its fair that I pay less this quarter because I hadnt been here.\n\nAITA for not wanting to pay a 3rd of the bills when I've only been there half of the billing period?\n\nEdit: I'm not going to stick them with the bill, I just want it to be proportional to how long i've been there.\n\nEdit: My mum only needed to stay for a week max because I wouldnt have been capable of taking care of myself, theyve had people stay longer without asking if Im ok with it. I had been discussing it with them for months prior. \n\nEdit: This was the first time I\u2019d ever left the balcony doors open, However, they\u2019ve been left open or unlocked for days at a time by other housemates. Our front door has a dicky lock, we have all left it unlocked before, I personally have found it unlocked 8 times in the last 6 months. And that\u2019s when I\u2019ve come home really late from work or functions.\n        ",

When my sister went back to work after her daughter was born, the whole family kinda pitched in the help with childcare so they didn\u2019t have to use a daycare. Her mother in law and our mother each looked after her for a few days a week. Eventually, with my extreme reluctance, I was rope in to help babysit maybe a total of seven day a month, sometimes more. Some of those day were super long, like eight hour days and I did this for about a year and a half. Somehow I become my niece\u2019s favorite person during this time.\n\nBut I hate children. I\u2019m childfree for a reason. And I\u2019m not exactly big on my niece either but I suck it up because I\u2019m adult enough to play nice with a small kid to help out my sister. But lately, it\u2019s become harder and harder to do this. I\u2019m not her mother so I defer to my sister in every case but it seems like the more I spend time with my niece the more my sister thinks I\u2019m doing things wrong. Or saying the wrong things. I have to police all my actions and my words just in case my niece takes it the wrong way or it doesn\u2019t align with her parents\u2019 parenting plans and I am feeling judged for not knowing better.\n\nLike yesterday we went to the park together. I was with my niece on the jungle gym and we were climbing it together. I got to a point where I wasn\u2019t comfortable going any higher and I said \u201cI\u2019m going to go down because it\u2019s scary\u201d and immediately my niece didn\u2019t want to go up any higher because she heard that and started parroting it. And now my sister is mad because I traumatized her daughter and peer pressured her daughter into limiting her possibilities because the person her daughter looked up to thought it was too scary. Okay, I\u2019ll refrain from commenting about things being scary from now on if it\u2019s damaging my niece so badly.\n\nThings like this seem to be happening more and more but I\u2019m starting to wondering if it\u2019s really worth it. She\u2019s not my kid, I don\u2019t actually have a duty to be around her if anything I do or say is bad. I don\u2019t even like kids and the way my niece is so fixated on me drives me a bit insane but I can suck it up because she\u2019s a kid and I can eventually go home. But lately, I\u2019m starting to wonder why I\u2019m doing this in the first place if it just makes me miserable. So WIBTA if I pulled away?\n        ",

When you open the app it transmits a video/audio stream of the room. \n\nOne day I got a notification and I opened it and it was my cleaning crew and I overheard them saying something about a party in my home, so I held on a second, since to my knowledge no one had stayed there in weeks. \n\nThis is the gist of what I heard \u201cJust a small party.\u201d \u201cWhat if someone\u2019s here?\u201d \u201cNo ones ever here and if they\u2019re having guests they\u2019d book us to come before so no one\u2019s planning on coming.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cCome on it\u2019ll be fun and he\u2019ll never know and where else would we do it?\u201d \n\nSo I made a mental note to figure out what to do about that later, then got swept up in work and holiday prep and forgot. \n\nThen about a week later I got a notification at night. I opened it and see two of the girls from my cleaning crew and five or six friends coming into my house. I remember the whole thing, I can\u2019t believe they\u2019d gone through with it. Of course as they walk in they unplug my cameras, I guess assuming I\u2019d think they malfunctioned or that I wouldn\u2019t check them?\n\nAs I\u2019m trying to make a decision, my neighbor up there calls and says \u201cyour guests are parked on my lawn you need to get them to move\u201d so I see the perfect solution, I say \u201cI don\u2019t have guests. If there are cars at my place, call the cops.\u201d He says sure thing and I thank him and I wait. \n\nWhat I thought was this would give the girls a scare and they\u2019d learn not to try stuff like this. The cops would call and ask if I knew them and I\u2019d say it was fine and they\u2019d be let go and that would be that. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect was apparently two of the guests had marijuana at this party, so two of the people there were arrested. \n\nNow I feel awful. On the one hand I couldn\u2019t have known that and if I hadn\u2019t overheard them I wouldn\u2019t have known who was over and definitely called the cops.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for telling my girlfriend I don't want to watch French language TV with her anymore? | My girlfriend is a native English speaker from the United States, whereas I grew up in Quebec, Canada, with French as my native language. We met when I relocated to California for a job. I'm completely comfortable speaking in English, but since we've moved in together and gotten a bit more serious she's insisted on trying to learn French for me. Part of that is immersing herself in French media. For the past few months, we've been watching Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois TV together a couple nights a week. This is where the problem arises - for me, this is just supposed to be fun, but for her, this is study time. She always pauses the show in the middle of important scenes so she can look up words she doesn't understand. Plus, she insists on turning on the subtitles so she can better understand what's going on, which I think ruins the comedy. Last night I finally cracked and told her I didn't want to watch TV with her anymore. At first she said it was fine, but this morning she told me I really hurt her feelings. So, reddit, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: This post got a lot more popular than I was expecting! Thanks to all of you for your input. Also, because there's a debate about my girlfriend's language-learning methods in the comments, I want to clarify that she isn't just using TV shows to learn. She's also attending classes and going to meetup groups. Also, when she's watching TV, she's not using English subtitles, she's using French. She's making lots of progress!\n\nIt seems that most of you agree that I was the asshole. My girlfriend and I have a very loving relationship, and I feel awful for hurting her feelings, so I took time to talk with her today and apologize. She said she felt hurt that I wasn't more supportive of her efforts to learn French. We've been to Quebec together a few times, and apparently, each time she felt like an outsider because she couldn't speak the language. I had no idea - I always made an effort to include her and translate for her when necessary, but I guess it wasn't enough. From my perspective, I love her language and her culture, and I'm fine with living in it together, but now that I've heard her perspective I understand how important it is for her to learn French so she can really get to know my family better and understand my background. She also mentioned that she's embarrassed that she can only speak English and that her French isn't very good and she speaks with a heavy accent. I reassured her that I find her American accent extremely charming.\n\nOverall, I really didn't realize how sensitive of an issue this was for her. I suppose I thought of this as a hobby of hers, but now I understand that this is her way of showing me how much she loves me and wants our relationship to succeed. So I'd like to think I'm not a complete ass, just a bit daft. Our solution is that we'll spend some time together watching the shows and movies together each week, just not before bedtime. (I think sleep deprivation is part of the reason I'm cranky about it.) She'll write down the words she doesn't know and ask at the END of the show, not in the middle. I also think I'll surprise her with some love letters in French from time to time. Maybe I'll make her a French playlist on Spotify, too? I promise moving forward to being extremely supportive of her efforts.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA - Not helping my wife put away Costco groceries | Going to start this with I know I'm an asshole. In this case, I also know I am part of the asshole to blame. My wife wanted me to post this because she thinks it is all on me. I am willing to find out if the majority think with her or with me.\n\nSome background so that you realize I am not here looking for relationship advice. My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and with dating up to about 30 years. Our relationship is anything but perfect and our primary dynamic is bickering. Also I am a certified Lazy POS and my wife is a workaholic who will invent work to do if she doesn't have anything to do. So there is a rub as well.\n\nOn to our story. Arrive home from Costco. Unload the car and get everything inside, either on the counter or stacked up just inside the door. Wife starts working on the kitchen items and I start lugging all the heavy shit downstairs and putting it away. I get done with the heavy stuff, see that she has about 7-8 items left and I go sit down and turn on the TV. She see this and tells me that we aren't done and that she is still working and I need to come help. I tell her that I am done with my part (yes I know it is all part of it, but hmmmmm) and that she can finish up the light stuff. Here is the crux of the argument. I say that I finished moving the heavy things that she can't (or at least not without great trouble) move and I don't think I need to come help her with the rest. She, well within her rights I don't disagree, tells me to \"get off my lazy ass\" and help her with the rest. Bicker mode \"Engage\"!\n\nI say that if she doesn't like the arrangement, I will unload the lighter stuff, which will take longer and she can deal with the heavy shit and that is acceptable to me, OR we can do it all together, meaning that we can both start with either heavy or light and do it all together. I said that either of those are acceptable to me, but griping at me that I am not doing my share when I am doing the things that she will struggle with or will be incapable of doing are not the same. She is not on board with either of those because the heavy stuff is too heavy for her.\n\nSo there we have it. Yes I know I am an asshole already. Pretty much prepared for that, but what I want to know from the community is if I am the sole asshole or is this an ESH where she bears some of the blame.\n\nWe both eagerly await your judgement.\n\nEDIT- Trying to clear up some things.\n\n1. I AM LAZY! This is not from her calling me lazy. Or anything exterior. This is self-actualization. I KNOW I am lazy. I would rather not do things. This is not to say that I don't take care of my responsibilities. I am lazy when it doesn't matter. Clean the garage or play video games? Not a competition. Both cars fit in the garage. Nothing is in the way or causing danger. Fuck that. It doesn't have to be done right now. That kind of lazy. Not the snort cocaine, sell the TV and not have a job lazy.\n\n2. Relationship, therapy and counseling - LOL. Thanks for everyone's advice that I/we need to seek counseling immediately. I tried to make it clear that this relationship dynamic is part of who we are as a couple. It may sound bad to you, but it works for us. We actually love each other. We are each other's best friend. Let me know if you never argue with your friends. Now live with that friend for 20+ years and see how it goes. Not to mention, if you haven't before now, please see above. I AM LAZY! Divorce would be a complicated, time sink pain in the ass! Not to mention I would then probably have to date and try and find someone else. Then I would need to spend a year getting used to all that person's weird idiosyncrasies. Not to mention dating and all the hassles that come with that. PASS. \n\nIATA -  Looks like the consensus is I am pretty much the sole Asshole here. Damn. Fine. I will help her with the small shit. (Not that I normally don't anyway, but apparently it will look better to the therapist if we play the \"he never helps put away the groceries\" card instead. ;p) I maintain my right to bitch and complain about it however!\n\nThanks everyone. Today my wife gets to be the mayor of ITOLDYOUTOWN.\n\nFinal Edit - Shit goes DOWN! (aka the only place \n\nSo the wife came home and ...\n\nSorry. No big drama here. Just a regular old married couple talking to each other. Here is where you can turn back to 18 and Knocked up if not interested in the mundane details of couples doing normal couple shit.\n\nWife walks in. I immediately announce that I have posted our question to the rabble, ( I talked you all up a bit more than that.) and the verdict is in.\n\nShe comes around the corner and gives me a cool stare. \"Aaaand?\" Because she already knew the answer because by now you would know my wife is wicked smaht. And of course I LIED MY FUCKING ASS OFF!!! Told her that barely anyone was on her side and that most people said if I didn't divorce her she should be so goddamn lucky!\n\nGame! Set! Match! ASSHOLE!!!!! We always win!\n\nAnd if my comments hadn't been downvoted into oblivion by some crazy ass mofo's you would already know that nothing of the sort happened because DUH. Actual couple. Actual life. Actual husband and wife that oddly aren't just the one little snapshot we present as a little glimpse into our own personal fucked upedness (not a word), but rather a complex intertwined web of two individuals who, over time have made a whole.\n\nAnyway so of course I told her that she was overwhelming correct and I am in fact, no shock to anyone in that room, an asshole. Not all the time, but definitely in this case. At which time we got to sit down and have a nice chat about our relationship. Which is something I know many of you will find shocking, but we do quite a bit.\n\nI told her that everyone online (with a few exceptions of what seems to be mostly older married couples oddly enough. not odd) thought our relationship was dysfunctional and that we needed to seek professional help immediately. To which she didn't immediately respond that's stupid. (Duh duh DUHHHH!!!! Now we are getting to the juicy stuff. I knew this guy was a real dick. Interwebs JUSTICE! (Parenthetical break inside a parenthetical break? Is this even legal? Think Deadpool here. I have to explain my humor to some folks because even after all this crazy shit I have typed, they still don't seem to get it. So just dropping this off here. The previous parenthetical break was as if I were speaking in the voice of someone with a justice boner for this post and that was hoping I would get my comeuppance (<-- real word. How deep does this fucking go. Inception post)))\n\nWhere did I drop that train of thought. There it is. So yeah she gave me the thoughtful silence for a few moments before responding. I wasn't running a tape recorder so all of this is paraphrase (with my own voice since I done spent all them college years learning to write good), but she said that there would be no point because what would we be trying to solve? We know each other. She says what I lack in our relationship is perspective. With regards to us, I only have myself and I always think I am right. I need outside perspective often because I tend to be my own echo chamber. (She's spot on with this one.) As for the rest, she knows I am a \"lazy\" (man that word sure launched a thousand tirades. Triremes? Helen of Troy? Trojan War? Too much?) bitcher, as in one that likes to bitch. But she has shit about her that I have to deal with as well. Basically we aren't the exact same people we were 20-30 years ago, but we are still them. Our edges have filed away over the years. Especially the ones that bump up against one another. If I was still the same person that I was 20 years ago, we would be divorced. But the opposite also holds true. If she would have remained the same, I would have been gone (me here: Didn't you say you were too lazy to get a divorce?? Remember, if you can follow my twisted train of thought, this is me paraphrasing my wife). But we have mellowed a lot. Said that when we first got married, she wouldn't even ask me to take care of even trivial married stuff because she didn't want to endure the bitchfest I would put on.(Interactive mode back on)\n\nOf course I wasn't standing for that because it didn't ring true. We talked about how I always had to do the appointments for our first house because I had the flexible schedule and I was always doing stuff. To which she thought and responded yes. And then after a little more back and forth we decided that the purchase of our first home was sort of a watershed moment in my penchant for lapsing into grousing. (Felt like bitching was getting played out) And again ( I really can't stress this enough) since we are adults in an almost loving caricature (you don't know, until now, but I had to google how to spell caricature. I totally spaced it) of a romantic relationship, we determined that I definitely took on much greater responsibility in the relationship as a consequence of our first house purchase. (That place was a dump by the way and we polished that turd up as shiny as we could get it given our limited budget and still burgeoning total ignorance of anything home care related.) \"You resigned yourself to your fate.\" Direct quote which I thought was hilariously true. For which she determined that she was happy that it happened before we got our daughter, because if I had still been the same procrastinating, \"don't bother me with that shit\" jackass that I had been before my metamorphosis (hah. But seriously. How often do you get to use that word. I'm keeping it just for that reason alone) or acceptance of my fate, if you will, then I would probably be a weekend dad at this point. So for those of you who think I suck now, I used to be worse! But then again so was she. And to those of you that think we are self centered. You are right. We have always been jealous of our time alone as much as we have been of our time together. We found the balance that worked for us. Because we are both a bit self centered, we get that trait in the other and can work around it. See how it works? Her need to be a control freak dovetails nicely into my \"I don't give a fuck about (Insert something that doesn't matter and that I truly don't give a fuck about HERE).\" (Again, for the humor impaired, she really isn't a complete control freak and I give a fuck about a lot of stuff in our relationship.) And while presented humorously, it is also true. \nFor example. She loves planning trips. I don't mean, we should go to Disneyland. Let's look for some hotels loves to plan. She LOVES TO FUCKING PLAN! I am talking binders, travel times, bus schedules, full itineraries, hours of operation for the sites we will visit. Embedded pictures and maps. Yes I am talking in the age of tablets, we still get binders. The electronics just opened new vistas for her planning. And I like to not do any of that. I know. Knock you off your perch with a feather right? But I LOVE to drive. And she would rather not. So BAM! Couples therapy avoided by getting to know your spouse. Amirite?\n\nSo if you have somehow read all the way down to here. Just know that after our nice little chat, I looked over at my wife and she said, \"You realize there is a price for all this don't you?\" And I said, \"No I didn't actually. What price do I have to pay?\"\n\nShe looked at me and said,\" I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nCan you imagine reading thru all of this bullshit and this is just some shitty meme? It's not, but man that would have been absolute GOLD, Jerry! Yep with the exception of the Loch Ness Monster at the end, the rest of it is all true. Sorry. Sometimes us folks on the internet are just folks. Sorry our fucked up relationship doesn't match your fucked up relationship. Or that you feel we are just deluding ourselves still after all this time. Thanks everyone for your concern. As you can see, my wife knows my shit inside and out. Sometimes she just gets to let me hang myself and lets me play out all the rope I want.\n\nI'd keep going, but I think Kylie Jenner is about to reveal something about a new foundation. Can't miss that.\n\nLater.\n        ",

They both live with me, and they visit their dad, my ex, each weekend.\n\nLila is a freshman in high school. She doesn't actually have a lot of homework, just a bit, maybe 1 hour total. \n\nWhen she comes home from school (3:30PM) she usually wants to relax first and eat before doing her homework. A couple of months ago I started making her do her homework right away, and eat after it.\n\nLila doesn't like it, and complains about it, but I told her she's being dramatic. Normal, rebellious teenagers am I right? She says she comes home hungry and eating a bit would help her be more focused and give her more energy.\n\nI on the other hand think that Lila should do the homework right away, because the information is still fresh in her mind, and then she wouldn't have to worry about it when it's done. Also food is a great motivator so she'll get the work done quickly. It's not like I'm starving her or anything, I just think it's a good method.\n\nLila apparently told her dad that I don't let her eat before homework is done. And now he's mad at me, saying it's \"not healthy to refuse food\" and that \"she could develop an eating disorder\". I think she's being a dramatic, nitpicking teenage girl, and her dad is just blindly taking her side.\n\nSo what do you think, Reddit? Who sucks here?\n\nTLDR: I don't let daughter eat before she's done her homework, now her dad is complaining.\n\nEDIT: Yes, she was getting good grades and doing her homework anyways, but I just figured it's better for her to get to relax in the evening when all the homework is done.\n        ",

The bathroom is usually used by the female employees but it isn\u2019t labelled and we wouldn\u2019t object to anyone else using it. \n\nI headed up to use the bathroom and knocked before going in.

His pants were around his ankles and a horrible odor quickly emerged from the bathroom. The other guests at reception could now see him. I apologised frantically and quickly shut the door. The man didn\u2019t make a single noise and gave no indication of him being in the bathroom, from me knocking to me opening the door. I was informed later on he reported the incident and now HR will be questioning me in the next few hours.

He requested HR to fire me and stated I was irresponsible for opening the door like that without checking.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for arguing with a cop after not being given a ticket? | My wife and I have been in a bit of an argument the past 2 days because I talked back to a cop. For context we are both Canadian, I'm brown and she's white, both mid 30s. \n\nI drive a somewhat fancy car and sometimes I like to drive hard. I don't ever speed on local roads but I do occasionally accelerate hard after a light. I have 0 ticket and 0 accidents. I even go out with friends for track days to get my speed rush in.\n\nSo anyway, we are driving home from the gym and I'm first at a red light. When the light turns green I floor it. The road is 60kph and I hit 60 and hit the breaks to keep at 60. 2 seconds later I see the lights behind me. I didn't even realize at first I was being pulled over so I just slow down and pull to the right. The cop pulls up behind me and I'm a bit confused but whatever. I know I didn't do anything wrong. \n\nWe do the whole \"do you know why I pulled you over dance\" and he goes back to his car. He said the reason was speeding and reckless driving. I told him I definitely wasn't speeding and didn't go a km over 60. To this my wife squeezes my arm but I'm a bit angry at this point. \n\n15 mins later he comes back and tells me that he's going to let me off with a warning but to drive more carefully. I asked him what the warning is for and he said driving irresponsibly. \n\nI probably should've dropped it at this point but this was pissing me off. I told him what I did to drive irresponsibly and he said I was speeding. I told him if that's the case then to write me a ticket and I can see him in court with my dashcam footage which has the speed on it. \n\nHe asked me \"are we really going to do this?\" and i replied with something along the lines of wanting either a reason for being pulled over or an apology. He goes back to his car and writes me 2 tickets for speeding (20 over) and stunt driving. What a joke. \n\nMy wife is now furious with me because I pretty much guaranteed our insurance premiums going up for no reason. I told her that there is no way our premiums are going up cause I have the dash cam footage plus I actually did nothing wrong. \n\nI don't even want to get a lawyer for this because it's honestly complete bullshit that should be thrown out. \n\nI know I should've kept my mouth shut because nothing good could come out of it but I don't think I was being an asshole to the cop. I just want him to do his job properly. If I was speeding I want the actual ticket for speeding. Don't let me off just cause you feel like it.\n\nEdit: alright will accept that I'm TA but a few things I want to clarify \n\nI was going 60kph (37mph). I literally have video evidence of this. The cop gave me a ticket for going 20 over.\n\nWhen I say I braked to stay under 60 I don't mean I hit 60 then immediately braked. When I get to 50-55 I apply slight pressure to stop accelerating. \n\nThere were no cars in front of me or pedestrians even close to the intersection. \n\nI drive hard occasionally because I enjoy driving my car. Been driving almost 20 years and haven't had  a single ticket or accident. \n\nI am just clarifying all these things because people were making presumptions in the comments.\n        ",

I didn\u2019t want to hurt them with refusing this request, they were so glad to find someone who helped them in a foreign country. \n\nSuddenly I had no better idea in that situation so I made an unethical move: I gave them a fake phone number.\n\nI know it wasn\u2019t the best move. Technically I scammed that family. But giving my phone number for someone I met for the first time is too much for me. I was glad to help but I can't carry the burden of everybody on my shoulder.\n\nSo tell me fellow Redditors: Am I the asshole for refusing to give my own phone number and giving a fake one instead?\n\nEdit: Correct me.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for keeping a kitten? | Sorry for my formatting, I\u2019m new to Reddit and on mobile. \n\n I recently came upon a facebook post in a group for buying and selling things in my local area. The post was giving away 2 kittens (sisters,who were found as strays) for free. The current owner said they would prefer to keep the two together since they had a good bond. Understandable. Heres where things get interesting.\n\nI messaged the owner telling her that if she was unable to find a home that could accept both cats, I\u2019d be more than happy to take one. I would have loved to take both but I currently already have another kitten and my housing agreement only allows for 2 pets. She immediately answered sounding very excited giving me a description of the two cats and even scheduling a day to come to my place to introduce them to my cat and find the best fit for my home. The day came and she arrived with the cats. At first our cat did not really like the new kittens and was very scared and slightly hostile. We proposed the idea of them giving us a blanket that the kitten has slept on and letting us give it to our cat to adjust her to the scent, but the owner said \u201cI think it should be fine, why don\u2019t you take the cat and give it a trial run\u201d. I agreed but my wife was somewhat on the fence, and made her skepticism well known. The owner really seemed to want us to take one of the cats and said that one of the kittens (the one we did not take) was less playful and appreciated her alone time, and sometimes her sister would bully her when she was trying to rest. This made the owner believe that separation wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.\n\n We took the cat in and in the following days the new cat and our old cat have grown to like each-other and me and my wife have grown very fond of our new friend. At the end of the week the owner messaged us asking how the trial went and we replied \u201cgreat they cats are really bonding and we love having her. we\u2019ve decided to keep her\u201d. The owner replied with a guilt trip saying that she found a home that could take both cats and would like ours back, saying our cats sister has been acting different and is now lonely. I think this is ridiculous and she isn\u2019t being fair to myself and my wife so we have decided not to give the kitten back. So reddit, Am I The Asshole?\n\nEDIT: A few people have mentioned the \u201ctrial run\u201d, just to add clarification, the trial run was a trial for us to determine if the kitten was a good fit for us and our current cat. It was never stated that the old owner would recall the cat upon finding a different home.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks to the advice of another redditor I\u2019ll add this. When we replied to the original post we said that we would love to take the cat IF a home that could take them both could not be found. The owner replied saying they could not find a home for both and would agree to give us one. We were never agreeing to \u201cfoster a cat and the agreement was just to make sure there wouldn\u2019t be any fights between the new one and the cat we already had.\n        ",

On the whole, it's been a great trip, but I'm left with this conundrum after leaving the parks this evening.\n\nWe were waiting in line for the new Cars ride, and we got cut by some folks (one was a family that we had accidentally split, and one was some lady with a child that may have just been trying to cut the line, who knows). After this happened, my wife was visibly upset, and had a very angry face for the next 20 minutes or so. I asked her if she was upset (she clearly was), and why. She said how frustrated she was that people would cut in line, since that's expressly not allowed. I advised her to just let it go, as I didn't think there was any good in getting upset over it. My view is that people are going to do that, and yeah, it's irritating, but that's no reason to let it ruin your night. This only served to make her even more upset, and she began to say things like \"So what, I'm not allowed to have any of my own opinions or emotions?\" I responded to that as I always have, with a quiet, but clear \"No, of course you are. All I'm saying is that maybe there are better ways of expressing those emotions (or choosing to not express them), and that I didn't think it was very mature to mean-mug everyone in line just because you were ticked we got cut.\" Well, that's where things went pretty far south. She was really upset that I would say that she was being immature, and was in tears by the time we got to the front of the line.\n\nWe made it through the ride, and I decided that it would be best if we just went back to the hotel instead of going for more rides, since she wasn't in the most emotionally stable position to be in public. We proceeded to argue for the next hour or so at the hotel, with my position being pretty consistently \"You can feel however you want about whatever situation you want -- where I take issue is when your choice of expression of those emotions start to affect other people, e.g. me or others.\" She continually paraphrases what I say into \"So you're saying I can't have emotions, or I can't express them?\" I'm doing my best to try to be clear with what I'm saying, but maybe I'm just TA here. Help give me some clarity?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Yup, I got it, I am most definitely TA. After some collective digging, this turned out to be more of a communication problem that we had tonight than anything else. Talked to my wife again, she agrees, and I went through a lot of what was explained to me through the discussion below. Big thank you to u/figferret, u/tritoeat, u/queensnewgroove, and u/BeckyShark for helping me to see some of the things I couldn't, and providing some great directed feedback on ways I can be better.

I went vegan just this year but I'd been making vegan desserts/dishes for a while then because it helped make it a bit easier for me to avoid dairy. \n\nMy mother was hosting (Canadian) thanksgiving this year. She asked me to make a couple side dishes and dessert - no one else in my family really likes to/can bake, and they like my vegan desserts just fine. I made the same dessert I'd made last year that we all liked - a vegan pumpkin pie. I made it really early this morning because it had to chill and set in the fridge for a good few hours. I carefully wrapped it up and stuck it at the bottom of the fridge behind a couple things so it wouldn't get knocked off. \n\nI'm not exactly sure how or why it happened, but my brother (30) went to get something out of the fridge and pulled out the pie to get at it and put it on the counter. He ended up knocking it off the counter and the pie plate broke and the pie was ruined. He went to the store and bought a store bought pumpkin pie.\n\nI had no idea about any of this until everyone started showing up at 5pm, as he didn't tell me until it was just about dinner time. I was really angry, as he's a very careless person and breaks my things all the time and this was just another thing he ruined. To make it worse, the pie he bought was filled with cream so I couldn't even eat it. I always feel so awkward being the only one not eating dessert at gatherings which is why I've always liked being the one making them.\n\nHe said well sorry and asked if I was mad at him and I said \"obviously, but I need to help mom with dinner now\" and I walked away.

I'm a vegetarian, so I looked for vegetarian options on the menu. The only thing I could eat without asking to change any ingredients was a salad. I was fine with this. I wanted the salad. But my dad took it upon himself to explain to the waitress that I was a vegetarian and tell her that I actually wanted one of the pasta dishes minus the meatballs (I never said this).\n\nI did not want the pasta dish. I wanted the salad, and told the waitress so. Dad, for some reason, wouldn't have it. According to him I did want the pasta. I was just too polite to ask for a special request. Once again I corrected him and politely but firmly repeated to the waitress that I wanted the salad. I gave Dad a pointed look, asking silently for him to drop it. But by this point the waitress got the impression that I really did want meatless pasta and really was just too polite to ask for it. She assured me that the cooks wouldn't mind making it for me if that's what I wanted. I couldn't make it more clear that I didn't want it, but after at least another full minute of back and forth about it between me, my dad, and the waitress (Mom stayed quiet) I finally gave in and said \"Okay, I'll have the pasta!\" just so we could all move on with our lives.\n\nWhen the food came out I took a few bites, but otherwise left the plate untouched. I'll admit I partly did this to be petty, and also so my dad couldn't use seeing me finishing my plate to tell himself that he was right to push the damn pasta (he pushes things a lot and can be controlling, so I try not to give him reasons to think that's okay). I wasn't pouty about it, though, and conversed as normal with my parents until Mom pointed out that I wasn't eating. I explained, again, that I never wanted the pasta and only had it in front of me because Dad forced it. This made Mom try to order me the salad I wanted in the first place when the waitress came back over to check on us!\n\nAgain I tried to stop the waitress from taking the order -- at this point I didn't want anything at all -- but then BOTH my parents waved me off and told the waitress to \"just bring her the salad.\" For some reason this is what finally caused me to snap and I said, way too loudly, \"I DON'T WANT A SALAD!!!\" Like, other diners going silent and looking over at our table, waitress standing there stunned kind of loud. I immediately regretted yelling, but at least all three of them finally listened to me and no one made me order anything else. On the way home Mom scolded me for being rude and Dad said *I* \"made a big deal out of nothing.\" They think that I ruined the evening by being immature. I do agree that I could have handled the situation better, but I think it's their fault for being so pushy and not listening to me.

So here\u2019s the situation.\n\nMy wife and I have been together ten years, married since October. I love her and she is wonderful and we are each other\u2019s best friends, and we fight very little. We are both 31 and not kids in this endeavor.\n\nIn January, we miscarried our first attempt at having a baby. It was very sad for both of us, but my wife took it very hard. Now the present, we are 14 weeks pregnant and around 8 weeks (one week past our previous miscarriage and with a strong heartbeat), she bought a pregnancy book/baby planner and started filling it out. She stated that she wanted me to fill it out as well, because she wanted baby to be able to look back when he or she is older and see how excited we were for their arrival. I wrote a little bit in it, but then put it off and did not write more, despite her bugging me about it. I knew the oncoming storm of telling her I didn\u2019t want to do it, and wanted to avoid it as long as possible\n\nThe other day, she confronted me and stated the fact that after weeks of her bugging me and I still had not even touched the book, she took my actions very personally and was starting to get upset about it. I told her honestly that it was just not something I wanted to do, I didn\u2019t think it was necessary and honestly a bit pointless. I told her that if she wanted to write in it that was fine but I should not be forced to.\n\nShe stated that when she was a teenager, she found her own mother\u2019s pregnancy book and it made her happy that she was so loved even before she was born, but that it made her a bit sad that her dad had not been a part of it. She wanted baby to have the experience of knowing both their parents were excited enough to write in it.\n\nShe is a history buff, so she is interested in that kind of stuff \u2014 I\u2019m not, and told her this and that I never would have given a crap about the book if I had found it, so why would our kid? She countered that baby is half her, so he or she has a 50% chance of wanting to see it.\n\nSo now we are at an impasse. I conceded and said I would fill it out, but then since she is a woman and hormonal she immediately said forget about it and that she \u201cwon\u2019t force me to do something that I CLEARLY don\u2019t want to do.\u201d So now I\u2019m still the bad guy.\n\nSo, Reddit, you\u2019re always honest with me. Am I the asshole for not wanting or caring about this pregnancy book, and not wanting to fill it out? I do understand it\u2019s something she may need to do \u2014 she has confided in me about how scared she is about another miscarriage and I think maybe this is her way of staying connected with the baby and getting herself through the pregnancy. But I don\u2019t see why I have to do it, too. It\u2019s her thing.\n\nTl;dr : my wife is filling out a pregnancy/baby book and wants me to write in it too, but I don\u2019t want to and tell her as such. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: the \u201cwoman and hormonal\u201d words were actually ones my wife has been using lately, however I can now see that while it is totally okay for her to say it, it makes me look like a  misogynistic* dick.

On the other hand, my older sister (22) and her boyfriend (\\~30) ask me for money multiple times a month, and when I do lend them money they never pay me back on time and then ask for more money just a few days later.\n\nRecently, my older sister and her boyfriend have been struggling a lot financially. Her boyfriend got into a car accident and was deemed at fault, so his insurance only covered a small amount of the damages. Due to this, he lost his only means of transportation and was no longer able to work. He applied for EI but hasn\u2019t heard back yet.

I explained to him that I only have enough in my checking account to cover my expenses until my next payday, and if I touch my savings I will get charged a fee for it, so I can lend him money when I get paid next if he still needs it. He messaged me daily for the 5 next days asking over and over again for me to lend him anywhere from $50-200 and I told him the same thing each time.\n\nI spoke to my mom about it and she told me that they have been doing the same to her and my dad and they have been saying no each time. My mom has been helping them financially since they got together a few years ago and even let them live at my parents house until they could afford an apartment. Both my mom and I helped them with stuff for their apartment and I even took a day off to help them move.

They can come in/leave when they want. \n* We all chipped in for some couches and video games in the main room. \n* If anyone were to have a baby they would get 4 months of paid leave.\n* We have the highest productivity and highest employee satisfaction in the company\n* Most days nobody leaves before 5. The employees hang out when they're done with work or wait for me/my assistant and we'll for drinks with our spouses (my assistant and I are married, to different people)\n* I host a weekly barbecue with my 16 yo daughter and my assistant's 13 and 12 yo kids as well.\n* The employees have jokingly referred to us as Mom and Dad. It's an exceedingly well functioning work environment. They come to me for advice and we joke around. I care about my employees on an individual level and would help them out any way that I could.\n\nI'm overall an excellent boss. \n\nThat brings us to this past week. I'm already in a bad mood because my daughter has been going through a MAJOR rebellious phase after we told her she was adopted and has been a disrespectful nightmare. We're giving her a long leash and going to therapy but it's stressful and I would like work to be not so.

I told her to watch herself, that I'm not her friend or her father that she can speak to me like that, I'm her boss. I said if she speaks to me like that again she's fired. It's worth noting that I said this calmly and did not yell. She apologized and looked upset which made me feel bad. She also had red eyes later in the day. The other two were giving me looks all day and my assistant said there was no need to be mean. \n\nAnna and the others have been subdued all week. My wife says that I unnecessarily took my anger out on Anna. I say that I didn't respond in any way that would be unreasonable from any other boss being called an asshole by his employee, and why should I be treated any less respectfully?

So, Reddit, WIBTA if I let this situation fizzle out without apologizing for appropriately reprimanding my employee?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: snapped at my employee.

You're also all right in that we have a friendly, joking atmosphere and I flipped my lid for no reason because I was feeling trod on at home and at work.

We got a confirmation that 2 close friends of ours wanted to play again this year, and we could probably find another one to make it 12 teams. \n\nMy gf has brought up a couple times how she\u2019s excited for next season and should be better because she knows more about how it works (last year she asked me why I wouldn\u2019t give her Cook for dak, doesn\u2019t understand positional value). \n\nWhen she talks about it I kind of just nod and smile, because I know we are going to try to find someone else but don\u2019t know how to tell her. She is the odd person out in the league if we have an odd number and I don\u2019t want to sound like a dick. \n\nAita?\n\nEDIT before last season I did tell her that we needed her specifically for the upcoming season, I didn\u2019t specifically say she was in like for good.\n        ",

It's five years in, we just had our first baby and a great marriage but the guilt just eats at me night and day. | I literally just found this sub today and I hope I am following all the rules. I am not looking for any sort of absolution or advice because really nothing can be done at this point. I just want to know if the feelings I have are justified...hence: am I the asshole. \n\nSix years ago I was 22 and started dating the absolutely most perfect guy on the planet. Saw sparks immediately, fell hard for him within the first few dates, he says he fell just as hard. We had an amazing first year courtship. I mean literally out of a fairytale romance novel. I was so in love with him I could not see strait. \n\nSo exactly one year in, his high school sweetheart shows up on the scene with a baby she claims is his. The timing of it was right from the last time he's seen her (kid was about 2 years old) and she claimed that she didn't know who the baby's father was at first but now was certain it was him and she needed him in his life. This part of the story could go on for pages but fast forward to the baby wasn't his, DNA test proved it. It was some sort of crazy girl shakedown because the real father wouldn't buy her a car or some such craziness that people get themselves into. \n\nI was so relieved and figured our relationship would continue unabated after this minor bump in the road. However the baby scare freaked him the fuck out. He claimed he was still in love with me but he'd seen into the face of fatherhood and commitment and he just wasn't ready and broke up with me. I was devastated beyond words. Like couldn't eat sleep, eat or even breathe. He went off on a summer vacation to solo travel around Europe. About two weeks in, I decided I couldn't be without him so I texted him that I needed to talk. He didn't respond right away so maybe two days later I texted him back that I was super late, was probably pregnant and I wasn't asking for him to come back, I just wanted him to be aware. I 100% was not pregnant.  \n\nHe called me immediately and asked what my plans were. I told him that I planned on getting an abortion but I felt like he should know. He told me to not do anything rash and that he would change his ticket and come home as soon as he was able. So when he got home he told me that he loved me, that he wanted to be with me, that his ex-GF scare wasn't my fault and he was sorry he bolted and that he wanted to keep the baby. I really hadn't planned for that happening that quickly. \n\nSo perhaps fortunately I got my period maybe two weeks later and was able to convince him that he blood was probably a miscarriage. I told him I was too scared to disappoint him and pretended to drive myself to planned parenthood where I concocted a fake miscarriage story. He never asked for any proof but he was deeply upset that the \"baby\" didn't make it. \nI pretended to be upset by the \"miscarriage\" too.\n\nWe pretty quickly both realized that it was probably for the best and our relationship more or less picked up where it had left off before. We aren't not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but I truly love him. He supports me in my career and now being a stay at home mom, he's amazing, he's wonderful and I can't live without him. We got married about 3.5 years ago.\n\n\nSo in December we had our first baby, an amazingly beautiful little boy who we both adore. My husband is amazing father and is willing to sacrifice just about any material good so I can be a SAHM. Everything we have is amazing. He's in the Navy, we live in an amazing little beach side community in California, he's a wonderful dad. I could not ask for more. \n\nBut I know in my heart all of it is based on a lie.

I was in Premium (basically first/business class) where there\u2019s huge comfy seats that recline and have a foot stool and you get served dinner and breakfast before you land. There\u2019s also quite a bit more leg room than in economy. \n\nWhen I was getting dinner, the flight attendant asked if I wanted to be woken for breakfast and I said no. We were leaving in the early evening but with the time change we would be arriving in the morning, so I was planning on sleeping the whole flight to try and not throw off my schedule as I had a long day ahead of me when I landed. After I ate, I took melatonin, put on my eye mask and ear plugs and fell asleep.\n\nAround 2 and a half hours before landing I am shaken awake but the person behind me. Once I get myself sorted I ask why she woke me and she said it\u2019s breakfast time and I need to put up my seat so she can eat. Looking around, the windows are still blacked out and more than half the people are still asleep. I told her I asked not to be woken for breakfast and she said \u201cthey\u201d (Guessing she meant the flight attendants) said to move the seats up. Once again there\u2019s loads of people with their seats back, and the seats in premium are much more roomy (think like twice as much space). \n\nAt this point, the FA came around with her meal and I stared at him the whole time he was setting up and explaining her meal, basically waiting for her to bring it up in front of him to see if he would back her up, but she didn\u2019t say anything so I put my ear plugs and she mask on and laid back down. At this point, I wasn\u2019t able to fall back asleep anyway (light sleeper) but I kept my seat reclined until descent.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering - Was I the asshole? If I had been in economy, I would have brought my seat up because those seats are admittedly tight, but I paid for premium knowing I would want to sleep, and I just found her to be entitled. It\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t eat unless I brought my seat up, right? Well, reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: Since more than one have mentioned this, I wasn\u2019t keeping my seat reclined to be vindictive. I tried to go back to sleep but failed and by the point I gave up trying, everybody that I could see had finished eating so I figured there was no point in moving my seat up by then. I actually feel bad for not moving it up since I didn\u2019t fall back asleep but that wasn\u2019t my intention at the time.\n\nEdit 2: Not trying to be defensive, just adding this because I want a fair consensus - there was plenty of room to eat even with the seat down. Premium is literally business class - free alcohol and snacks, the hot towel, the works. Like I said it\u2019s at least twice as roomy. When she woke me, she never brought up the lack of space or anything.\n        ",

For reference throughout the story, all the utilities are in my name because though I asked her 3 times throughout the week to set up one of our accounts while I took care of the other, she never got to it, and so I took care of it because it needed to be done. \n\nTwo days after we moved in, she asked me if her sister could come for the holidays, to which of course I said sure. I assumed that meant a week or so, maybe 2 weeks. She stayed seven weeks, was a not very good houseguest, and after six weeks I asked Sophie to pay 2/3 of the utilities at least since she and her sister spent most of their time in our apartment and I work about 50 hours a week outside the home. She said yes, but I had to remind her 3-4x to pay up. \n\nIn August, she asked me if her friends could come stay a month. I said yes, but I expected them to pay their share and that I would charge them 3/4 of the utilities because there were 3 of them, and I\u2019d be gone two weeks of it. When I returned from my trip, the apartment was a disaster, her friends were rude to me, and I had to tiptoe around my apartment because her friends took naps/slept a long time on the couch in her living room. Once more I had to chase her for the utilities. \n\nLess than a week after these friends leave, she texts me and TELLS me that her sister is coming for a week. I told her it was not okay that she was not asking but simply telling me and I was not thrilled with our arrangement and that I\u2019d be moving out when the first year of our lease was up. She apologized, and said okay. \n\nMy new roommates need me to move in December 1, when my lease ends Dec 6. We are charged a prorated rent for those days, which will end up being $320.

However, I will be asking her to pay the full utilities for the time she\u2019s there herself (now a full two weeks as my work schedule has made it so the only day I have available to move is 11/25)\n\nAlso thank you for validating my feelings that it was not an okay thing.

Nosy neighbor came to complain that I am endangering others for speeding. Told him if he didn't leave i'd call the police on him for trespassing. \n\n\n\nFull story. \nSo I live in a rural area on the outskirts of the city because I like peace and quiet. We recently got a new neighbor over a month and a half ago and the houses in this area are spread out quite a bit and our house happens to have a very long driveway/street which is on our land. This being a driveway, it has no speed limit signs posted or anything. Our driveway out here is fairly long though. It runs from the main road about a mile and a half to our house.\nOur driveway is also fenced. Once you drive off the main road and go through the gate, you're on our driveway.\n\nNow, because we have our own private road basically, I treat it how I want since it's on our land and isn't governed by the city/state etc. This road has now laws so I speed up and down it as fast I can for shits and giggles. It has a few turns so it's fun to whip my little MX-5 about in when I go to the store, work or really just whenever I am coming and going because I find it fun and its not hurting anyone. \n\nWell apparently our new neighbor across the street has noticed my \"dangerous\" driving. How? I don't know. You basically need binoculars to see your neighbors house because my drive is a mile and a half long and so is his. He came over one day after I got done speeding home from work, banged on my door and told me that I need to stop speeding and driving so recklessly and told me that I could hit someone and how I am endangering others.\n\nI told him that it's my street, on my property which I own and that it's not a through street that just anyone can use because it's a private drive. I also told him there are no posted speed limit signs and that I had no intentions of ever putting one up and that I can't endanger anyone since no one should be driving down my street to begin with. (and there is a gate that's always closed unless I open it or leave it open) Further more if someone is driving down my street it's usually planed and I know they are coming. Lastly, it's not like I am driving up and the driveway all day every day.

So she\u2019s single now and isn\u2019t actively dating, but isn\u2019t opposed to it if a good opportunity arises. She likes tall, handsome, athletic, white guys. Nearly every one of her past boyfriends fit that mould. \n\n\nSo she told me last night that she got hit on by an NBA player during her girl\u2019s night out last weekend. She told me who.

He barely buys his own stuff, let alone for the household. My mom buys his soap, food, bus passes, etc. He even tries to eat my food I've labeled 'NoNo' (as in 'No Noelle (my name)' - don't eat). It really pisses me off that he eats my food, takes my stuff & doesn't contribute anything. I'm fed up with it. I've brought it up to my mom several times and she always says \"I know\" or \"I can't make him contribute\" or \"I don't want to cause an argument.\"\n\nI buy q-tips to help me apply my makeup.

I told him he needs to start buying his own toiletries and food and start contributing to the house more, and that it's not fair we have to buy things to support him too.

This is also my first proper post, so bear with on style and grammar.\n\n\nBackground: My fianc\u00e9 (F) has a big family, so we are having a reasonably large wedding with plenty of room for all the relatives.\n\nHowever, a particular aunt and her husband (we'll call them AU) have caused F and his brother (B) a lot of pain in the past.\nWhen F's father passed away AU tried to get a share of a life insurance payout. \nAU thought they were entitled to a share, and made things quite unpleasant until they were told that they were not entitled and then dropped the claim. \n\nAU also arrived at the wake, after the funeral, asking where the family car was and wanting to see it. As they had been promised it by F's dad before he passed.  This upset F and many other family members, as it was very inappropriate to be talking about what they were getting out of a family bereavement at the funeral. The situation resulted in F telling AU to leave. \n\nThey also claimed that F and B put their grandma into an old people's home because they couldn't be bothered to care for her. F and B visited every home in the area and picked the nicest one, they  invited AU to help them, but weren't taken up on the offer.\nF & B both work full time and were unable to care for their grandma any longer, at this point had been doing if for years alongside looking after their terminally ill father. F had been living with grandma up until now and had no help from AU.\n\nAU continually moans to B about not having met me, making things awkward at family events. I have actively avoided them, because I don't trust myself not to tell them what I think of them. \n\nFast forward to our wedding plans and I've been told by F that we should invite AU to the full day, just to avoid B having to deal with their spiteful comments. As B still sees them out of loyalty to his father's memory.\n\nI have refused to invite them, they have caused nothing but drama and heartache for the people I love and I don't want to spend such an important day biting my tongue. I'm someone who usually confronts things like this head on and it's stressful for me not to, but I respect F's request not to get involved.\nI have tried to compromise and said they can come to the evening, but F keeps saying I'm causing trouble for B by not having them there all day. He says I'm being selfish putting B in this situation.\n\nI feel I'm protecting F and B and ensuring they, and I, have a drama free special day. I feel like B needs to stand up to their bullying if they try and start a row about the invite, as he's put up with it for too long.\n\nTLDR: Aunt and uncle repeatedly cause family upset and money-grab. AITA for not wanting to share our wedding day with them? Even if it means they take it out on fianc\u00e9s brother?\n\nThrowaway account for anonymity.\n\nEdit: Update: Just want to say thanks for those who gave constructive advice (rather than angry rants). I definitely see now that he has a right to decide about his family and I don't. I think we need to find a middle ground, so we're both able to enjoy our big day rather than me dictating like a Bridezilla!\n        ",

I\u2019ll go ahead and lay out the situation for everyone:\n\nI am in the Army, currently in training as an Infantry Officer. If you want to take vacation in the Army you have to use what is called Leave Days. You accrue a certain amount of leave dates per month, 2.5/month for a total of 30/year, and you can use them however you like. You can also ask for days in advance, but that takes a whole other process that can easily get denied for whatever reason without there being a legal issue. Once you put your packet together, you send it up to your commander and they Approve/Disapprove the packet.\n\nWell I don\u2019t have that many days accrued because I just started active duty and none of my time as enlisted transferred leave days over since I technically left active duty before I started training. Our commander has said that he will be letting us take whatever leave we have accrued over the holidays for up to 17 days, but that he will be denying any advance leave packets because Jimmy Carter is about to die and we might have to go to D.C. for the funeral. I will have 5 days accrued by the time Christmas rolls around, but I want to save those because you also have to use leave for emergency things sometimes if it doesn\u2019t meet certain criteria.\n\nOther relevant information: I just got engaged last week to a wonderful woman that I\u2019ve been dating for 3 years. She is finishing up her degree this next month and then moving in with me while she studies for the MCAT.\nAlright now to the nitty gritty!\n\nWhen I broke the terrible news to her that Christmas might not be what we expected she was understandably upset. We had planned to fly out and do a trip with her family for the parents\u2019 30th anniversary. But upon mentioning the fact that I know she really wanted to go on the trip, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to as I most likely have to be here, she said, \u201cOh no I\u2019m still going, I want to be there for my parents\u2019 30th.\u201d\n\nNow I totally understand, it\u2019s a huge milestone, but they aren\u2019t throwing a party or anything for it, we were just gonna go skiing (might I mention that I was paying for both of us because I didn\u2019t want her parents to foot the bill). They also do something EVERY year for the anniversary so it\u2019s not like we couldn\u2019t go next time. So I voiced my concern that I would like her to be with me since it is our first Christmas officially \u201ctogether\u201d in her family\u2019s eyes now, and I could possibly be deployed this time next year as I\u2019m slotted to go to 10th MTN and they have done 96hr notice deployments before. She said that I was being unfair and that I was, \u201cTelling her not to spend time with her family.\u201d When in reality I just feel like I\u2019m a part of her family now and shouldn\u2019t be left by myself on Christmas. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting a lot of people saying I\u2019m the asshole because I won\u2019t be there during the day. I\u2019ll be back before she wakes up in the mornings and then a 5 minute check in at 1:30 and we\u2019d have the rest of the day off to do whatever. I just have to be here in case he dies, in which case she\u2019d go with me, I don\u2019t have anything to do all day.\n        ",

My mother went the route of cutting many foods from my diet to manage it. She bought me special groceries and it was an enforced rule that no one else was to eat them but me (so off limits to mom, dad, and brother). \n\nFlash forward to now: my IBS-D has gotten worse and more foods have been taken from my diet. (There is prescription medicine for this but my GI advised that it is not breastfeeding compatible). On top of that, I got an allergy panel done and even more foods on there that I shouldn't consume. Quote from my fiance: \"I can't think of anything left for you to eat\".\n\nI found these cookies - dairy free, gluten free, etc etc that are actually quite good. Also, as is most my food,  they are expensive. A month ago my fiance told me he didn't want me to buy him chips ahoy cookies anymore. That he needed to eat healthier. So I stopped. Now, he has taken to asking me if he can eat my cookies. At first, I laughed and said, are you serious? But then he ate some. He keeps asking, I say no, and he tells me not to be selfish as he eats some. I get mad. \n\nHe finally told me that he does it because he disagrees with the notion that I can have food that is off limits to others. He says he wants our daughter to grow up knowing how to share. He says I  should buy more of my cookies and let the household eat them.

        "input": "\n        scenario: WIBTA if I told my upstairs neighbours to shut their kids up? | I live in a flat, and recently we had some new upstairs neighbours move in. I haven\u2019t met or seen them at all yet, but I\u2019m about to lose my mind.\n\nThey clearly have a number of small children, which is fine. You expect some noise in a block of flats anyway, it can\u2019t be helped, and I get that kids can be noisy but this is actual insanity.\n\nFrom early morning to at least 10:30pm, every single day, they are tearing about the flat and screaming. Stomping SO loud non stop it\u2019s all we can hear, and screaming and shouting and jumping, dragging or throwing things across the floor etc. \n\nAs I say, this happening occasionally is to be expected, I don\u2019t expect a silent home when I live in a block of flats. But in my opinion this is happening beyond what would be considered reasonable.\n\nIt\u2019s not normal walking footsteps, it\u2019s loud, constant thudding and stamping. The screaming and shouting and crying is relentless and very piercing. And as I say, this goes on ALL day EVERY day and until way past 10pm every single night.\n\nAt a weekend I\u2019m completely fine with noise (we have other neighbours that at a weekend regularly have loud parties until 5am and I never complain - it\u2019s a weekend so crack on in my books); but during the week I think this is just rude and inconsiderate. There\u2019s no longer a moment of peace in our flat.\n\nI totally get that kids are a different ball game to parties, you can\u2019t tell people to keep their kids silent. But I really feel like more could be done to at least minimise some of this noise, at the moment it sounds like these kids are allowed to constantly run absolute riot.\n\nWould I be an asshole if I said something? Maybe a (very politely worded) note through the door? I know notes are a bit passive aggressive but I feel knocking on the door could be a bit confrontational...\n\nMy flatmate also finds this infuriating, but her view is \u201ckids will be kids, we can\u2019t tell them to shut their kids up, it\u2019s asshole behaviour\u201d. Whilst I would usually agree with this, for example I\u2019d never complain about a crying newborn or something like that that can\u2019t be helped, I think this is just unreasonable from the neighbours. If not the level of noise, at least the time of night it goes on to (and duration).\n\nSo, would I be a massive asshole for telling these new neighbours to rein their kids in before I actually lose my mind??!\n\n\nEdit - more info:\n\nI should have probably explained originally, but the parents are also very loud too, I certainly don\u2019t get the impression that they\u2019re concerned about the noise anyway. For example, today they\u2019ve been blaring music along with the usual kid noise, and having really loud conversations and adult shouting/chatting. The main problem is definitely the kids, but basically my point is the adults are contributing too so I don\u2019t think they care.\n\nWe don\u2019t live in a paper thin walled apartment either, it\u2019s really solid wall/ceiling, we\u2019ve never experienced this level of noise before from any of our neighbours so they really are going some to be so loud!\n\nI\u2019m at a loss of what to do, I really don\u2019t want to be confrontational or put their backs up and I appreciate kids are hard to control, but it\u2019s making life miserable. \n\nThe problem is my flatmate thinks I\u2019m being a total asshole for even considering saying anything, so I\u2019m at a bit of a blocker! I\u2019m glad most people seem to think I\u2019m not though, so I\u2019ll show her this post...\n\n        ",

At first, my siblings and I planned to confront dad first then let him tell mom but since he didn't buy my brother the car he promised and didn't take us on the vacation we wanted we we're even more angry with him so we decided to just tell mom anyway. \n\nWhen we had family dinner, my sis went and got the printed results and confronted our parents. Dad of course went red, then started crying, apologised to mom and then just left the house. Mom didn't say anything for a while but then she called us down a few days later and told us that she's angry at the way we revealed dad's infidelity. She told us that we really humiliated and hurt dad and than we should apologise to him. Mom has forgiven dad way too quickly in my opinion and wants to go to marriage counselling/therapy with dad but he won't go because we've destroyed him or something like that. I don't think my siblings and I did anything wrong but mom thinks so. She told us that we should've talked to dad first rather than embarrassing him in front of her and making him cry and run to uncle's house. AITA (and my siblings) for making my dad cry like this or we're we justified?\n\nEDIT: Dad isn't talking to us now and just hugging mom whenever we see them so he's probably definitely still hurt.

The garden party started at 19:00ish.\n\nMy friend lives 40 minutes from me, and he is then an hour and 10 minutes from the party. I was driving and picking him up on the way.\n\nThe day before I had texted my friend and told him I would \"attempt\" to get to his house for 16:00ish, and that I wanted to detour slightly and pick something up on the way.\n\nWell on the Saturday afternoon I didn't end up setting off to my friend until about 17:45. My fault and later than planned but we would still arrive at a good time. I rang my friend at 16:00 and told him I wouldn't pick him up until later, possibly around 18:00. He was relieved as he had not got ready and was binge watching stranger things...\n\nI rang him when I had set off  telling him I would be there in half an hour. Again, he was relieved because he was STILL watching stranger things and hadn't got ready at all...fine I said, but please get ready now and we can get straight off when I get there...\n\nI arrived at my friends at 18:25, I parked up and rang him... To my surprise he said he had 5 minutes left to watch to stranger things and invited me inside, he has still not packed and was not ready to go. \"No!\" I said, \"I will wait in the car come down where you are ready\"\n\nWell 20 minutes passed and I eventually went inside to use the facilities. I waited while he continued getting ready and packing his clothes.. Nearly an hour later we were both in the car ready to set off. It was 19:20. He had taken 55 minutes getting ready...\n\nBear in mind we are still over an hour from the garden party, 20:00 would have been an okay time to get there I had thought. I then reminded him that we need to take a 20 minute detour as I need to pick something up on the way. He then moaned at me saying to leave it and head straight there. I told him if I had known he was going to take an hour getting ready I could have driven there and back. I was not changing my plans, he had already made us late. He said if anyone enquired as to why we were so late he would blame me. Ludicrous I said.\n\nDespite the tiff I still went on my detour which added 20 minutes to the journey. Certainly alot less than the 55 minutes I had to wait for him. Along the way I said we should probably stop off for somewhere to eat as the food will probably all have been eaten when we arrive. \"sure\" he replied.\n\nWell an hour or so passed and we were about 10 minutes from the party. Despite his protests I stopped at a mcdonalds as I didn't want to drink on an empty stomach. I went inside as I needed a wee and brought some food out, including some nuggets for him. As I sat in the car eating my burgers he had a go at me for not driving and eating at the same time and how I had made us late (the time was about 21:00)\n\nHow had I made us late?! I argued. I had given him ample warning what time I was going to be there. He was binge watching Netflix. I said he was disrespectful as he should have been ready when I arrived. He accused me of being disrespectful for not being there at 16:00. But I would still have had to wait an hour for him to get ready?! And I informed him at every step the time I was due to arrive. \n\nHe was not having it and declared that I was the reason we were late. And that what he would tell everyone. \n\nAm I the asshole for making us late?\n\n--I let him know at 16:00 what time I was going to be there. But he hadn't even began to get ready.\n\nIf had been ready to go when I picked him up we would have got there at an appropriate time\n\n- I didn't know I wasn't allowed to argue! \ud83d\ude02 It's my first post!\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for essentially siding with my family instead of my wife over their precautions for our incoming newphew? | Throwaway cause reasons.\n\nBackstory: my wife and I have two kids (9F, 4M). My wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an \"oops\" baby. She had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively. No major complications or anything like that. \n\nOn the other hand, my brother and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for my SIL, and utilize IVF in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows how much money. So when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal then I would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. For example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. My wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my SIL. She would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my SIL and she would basically replace it with her own idea. So that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. Otherwise everyone in our family has been supportive and excited. The baby is due at the end of this month.\n\nSo last night my wife received a Facebook message thread, including my parents and other family, from my SIL that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. My wife lost it. She started saying how completely insane my SIL and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet our nephew. \n\nWhile I said that I agree they are being a bit on the extreme side, I can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. They can't afford to go through IVF again and my SIL is too old it would be high risk anyway. My entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. We would just need to get our records. I also said I can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so I can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. But overall, I sort of understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.\n\nWell she took this as me siding with them over her. She's been angry with me ever since. AITA?\n\n(Also, please don't reply with \"YOu sHOuLd AlWays SiDe wiTH YOur WiFE! hUrrr Dee DurRR\". I don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... Don't bother.)\n\nEdit title: Nephew :/\n\nEdit 2: While my wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough I think the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). We are pretty close. We all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. They watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. There's always been full trust between us. And I think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted. I don't know if that changes anything? For those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?\n\nEdit 3: Holy cow, this blew up since last I checked. First of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. To address some common questions/comments... 1) No, SIL has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). Once again, we're all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. And there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) No, we did not ensure family was up to date on shots when our kids were born. I feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? It was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) It is highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. She's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower my SIL had. It was more the fact that my SIL rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) I probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the title... But I didn't really \"take a side\", at least I wouldn't consider it that. It's not like I said, \"Well hun, they are right and you are wrong\". It was more the fact that I wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that made her think I was taking their side (I think?). So take that for what it's worth. 5) I appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... I feel like that's what I tried to do here. Maybe I didn't handle it to perfection and I agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). Maybe I'll send an update if anyone is interested.\n\nEdit 4: Just cause it's hilarious that I actually have to address this... But no, I was not implying that just because the baby is IVF or their \"one shot\" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby. Not quite sure how some folks deduced that. I was merely saying that due to those circumstances I could more easily empathize with my SIL's somewhat extreme (imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't bother me as much as it did my wife.\n        ",

They raised me as an atheist but after high school I started to suffer from anxiety & depression, but eventually i had a friend help me find God and Jesus and that turned my life upside down. I still ahve anxiety & depression but its much milder now among other reasons because praying helps easing it.\n\nI pray a few times every day. So my problem is because my parents are atheist they have never liked that I need to pray but they accepted it until yesterday. They asked me if I could close the door to my room when i pray because they think its distracting. I said no because i like to have my door open so my cat can walk in and out, and yes I could close my door for two minutes during prayer but its also my house and Im a grown man, and if I can respect they're non-religion they should also respect my religion.\n\nI know I could just pray inside my head but when i do that other kinds of thoughts distract me so i need to pray out loud to be focused. I dont yell when i pray i just talk in a normal voice, so they can only hear me when their in the hallway.\n\nSo I refused and they've been pissed ever since and said that maybe I should move out soon, but thats not a possibility, I can't afford it as my depression & anxiety is still severe enough that I can't hold down a job. I'll also miss my cat too much if I move out\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Thanks to user/lauren898 for suggesting I whisper my prayers instead, I'll do that from now on!

I've been best friends with my best friend (we'll call him G) since kindergarten, so G and my sister have always been pretty close too. They've kind of had a \"thing\" going on our whole lives. For the longest time, they never officially dated for a bunch of different reasons I won't get into, but they were always really close and really into each other.\n\nA little over a year ago, when we were all 17, they finally started dating. Everything went really well for like 13 months, but then long story short, G cheated on my sister and I was the one who figured it out. He swore it wouldn't happen again and begged me not to tell my sister but I told her anyway. I was mad at him and he was mad at me so we didn't talk for a month and a half, which was honestly the weirdest month and a half of my whole life. G's practically like my brother, we've been inseparable since kindergarten, so not having him around was kinda....unbearable honestly lol\n\nAfter our streak of not talking to each other, G invited me on his family ski trip as a way to make amends (I've been on lots of his family's ski trips through the years). I accepted and ended up forgiving him and letting him back into my life because it was way too weird without him in it. I can tell he's genuinely sorry about what happened. He literally cried cause he felt so bad and I've only seen him cry like once before in my whole life\n\nAnyway, G and my sister broke up as soon as she found out he cheated and they're still not on speaking terms, so my sister obviously isn't happy about the whole situation. She's making me feel like shit for still being friends with G, and she doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it would be for us to lose our 13 year friendship over her. I know G made a huge mistake, I hate him for it and I'll never 100% get over it, but I'm not gonna let it ruin my best and longest friendship. I think about it like this: if your best friend cheated on their SO and then felt like shit, would you end your friendship with them? No. So why is this any different just because his SO happened to be my sister? G and I are going to the same college in the fall (a different college in a different state than the one my sister's going to), so none of this is gonna be something that we even think about when we're living in different places\n\nAm I the asshole?\n        ",

My sister and I are both around mid 20s. She\u2019s married, I had a boyfriend at the time and have always intended on having children. Names are changed in the post. \n\nMy older sister (D) has been married for about 4 years and currently has two kids. When she was pregnant with her second boy, she said she and her husband were planning on naming him a name that was intended to be shorted to two letters (think TJ, MJ etc). Initially this wasn\u2019t an issue because they picked two names I had no intention of ever using (not the actual name, but let\u2019s say they said they were going to name him Matthew John).  Months later, D mentioned they had decided to keep the letters the same but decided to use \u201cMichael\u201d instead. I told her that was the only name I\u2019d ever actually had my heart set on naming a child one day. I asked if they could just keep their original idea so I could still use my favorite name and I\u2019d liked for years and that they had just decided a few days ago that they wanted to use. \n\nI talked to her and my mom about it. D countered with them being set on it and there was no way they\u2019d go back to the other name. They both said I could still name my kid Michael one day. I said I didn\u2019t want to because I thought it would be weird to have two kids in the same family with the same name. She said everyone would be calling him MJ, so if I just named my kid Michael it wouldn\u2019t even matter since they wouldn\u2019t be going by the same name. She also said that because I wasn\u2019t even married yet my opinion didn\u2019t matter as much since they were having their baby soon and they liked the name. \n\nD has the baby, names him MJ with the name I wanted. Calls him MJ for a while. Then she starts calling him Michael often. Next thing you know, MJ is never used (by anyone) and it\u2019s Michael every time. I mention that they don\u2019t call him MJ anymore and how she said they were going to which was a big part of her justification on why I could still use Michael. She brushed it off as \u201che just didn\u2019t seem like an MJ and Michael fits him better\u201d. \n\nI understand she was actually about to have a baby and I wasn\u2019t, but since I told her right after they decided to change to the name I wanted I feel like she should\u2019ve at least been nicer about it or even considered changing it back or to something else. But she instantly shut me down with a \u201ctoo bad, we picked it\u201d attitude. It\u2019s caused a bit of a rift between us. My family is very close, so i see my nephew all the time and it kind of irks me that he has the name I always wanted. I\u2019m also kind of hurt that my mom took her side no questions asked. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*Edit* Michael isn\u2019t the actual name. The beginning of the post states the names were changed. The actual name I wanted is pretty unique/unconventional so it would definitely be odd to have two in the same family. Just to clarify.\n\n*Edit 2* I\u2019m sure I mentioned the actual name to her at some point, I just don\u2019t remember any exact conversations. I\u2019ve liked the name for years so I\u2019m sure it came up. But regardless, it appears I\u2019m the asshole here. Thanks for your opinions.\n        ",

All I know is from what my daughter says and from what the friend posts on social media.

The only problem is the friend's recent actions.\n\nThe friend has recently been indulging in some reckless behaviour: smoking pot, drinking alcohol, and dating an older guy (above the age of 20 who has been shown doing hard drugs in online posts). I learn about this from the countless posts the friend makes online. I know that my daughter has hung out with her friend when she was with the older man, and apparently he is a nice guy even though he is into drugs and is willing to date a minor (the age of consent where I'm from is 16, but I still find it inappropriate for a guy above 20 to be dating a 16 year old).\n\nMy daughter is a good kid, I trust her not to do anything bad but I know how teenagers are and how many of them will experiment with things like alcohol and drugs.

Recently the first major issue in our relationship came up and it has caused huge problems. In January of this year I started to get sick, I was nauseous, had a fever, I was laying on the couch under a blanket with the chills. I assumed it was some sort of flu. My wife on the other hand would encourage me to stay up and about, discouraged me from taking time off of work because we'd have less vacation time this summer, and very much down played how sick I felt. \n\nMy 'flu' went away in about 4 days, and came back with a vengeance 4 weeks later and also caused back pain.

She told me I had the 'man flu' and lectured me about how men who are barely sick exaggerate their symptoms because they don't know how to handle illness.

I'm mad at myself for cancelling my last appointment, I'm mad at my wife for insisting nothing is wrong and convincing me to cancel my last appointment. I'm just pissed.

My husband didn\u2019t seem to notice but he\u2019s oblivious when it comes to things like that. \n\nThe woman got off at the same stop that we did.

He said that they were doing a lot of estate planning recently. He talked about what I would be inheriting, what my half-sister would get, etc. He discussed what kind of lifestyle he would want her to have if they passed before she were an adult (my dad and step-mom are wealthy). Then they talked about how on our side of the family, there\u2019s not really anyone who could take her. My step-mom has some family that would step up and be guardians, however their first choice is me.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not anti-kids. I do want kids someday. I just\u2026don\u2019t want to promise to raise my little sister if anything were to happen. We\u2019re not close, if our dad and her mom were to die, I would not be a familiar/comforting presence to help her through it.

She begged me to come, wouldn't stop asking, told me she really needed me there. Eventually I gave in as long as she promised we could leave at 10pm.

Finally 10pm rolls around and I go find my wife, she's gossipping away to some woman, I listen for a few minutes then politely ask her for a word. We step away from the other woman and I tell her it's 10, time to go. She says just give me 20 more minutes, I'm having an important conversation with my supervisor. I call bullshit, tell get I was listening and it was just gossip. She says just 20 minutes she needs a good relationship with this woman. I tell her she has til the cab arrives then she can make her own way home. \n\nShe comes out just under 10 minutes later, just before the cab gets there, some guy asks where she's going and she makes up an excuse about the babysitter.\n\nWe argue on the ride home and she says I ruined her evening, embarrassed her and forced her to lie to save face, I remind her I didn't want to go in the first place but I was still on my best behaviour, I just wanted to leave when she promised we would. \n\nWhen we get home she tells me she's sleeping on the couch tonight. I told her unless she wants to sleep next to me watching TV for an hour or 2 no she's not. She says fine then you stay here. Nope, it's my bed too and I'll sleep in it if I want to. So she grabs a bag and says she's heading to her mother's (where the kids are). I say cool see you tomorrow then. She tells me no I won't unless I'm ready to apologize and slams the door.\n\nI really don't think I'm the one who needs to apologize here\n1) her reactions were way outta line: dictating where I sleep, slamming doors, leaving the house\n2) she nagged me into going to something I hated then broke her promise about leaving\nI don't see how I'm in the wrong?\nShe came home the next day but has been frosty with me all week and keeps saying I need to apologize. I'm getting sick of it and think she should apologize now honestly.\n\nSo aita? Did I ruin her night? Or is she ta for her reaction?\n\nEdit: damn autocorrect and not being able to edit the title\n\nUPDATE: Alright y'all looks like the general consensus is ita, I'd just like to shout out to all those who noted that my wife wasn't an angel in the scenario either, even if you did get down voted to hell, there were enough of you that I decided to stand my ground on a few things.\n\nSo I talked to my wife, I told her I was sorry for escalating the argument and not just sleeping on the couch and making her feel like she needed to leave, that was uncool, I was pissed about the evening and let things get out of hand. \n\nHowever I'm standing firm that she shouldn't have pushed me on going to this, she knows how much I hate these things and that if I say I'm not comfortable doing something it's not ok for her to wear me down into going through constant pressure and guilt tripping. I never push her on things she's not comfortable with and I think I deserve the same in return.\n\nHonestly I think I was never going to have a good time and it was doomed to end in an argument not just because I hate these things and didn't want to go but because I felt forced and that she didn't care how going made me feel.\n\nShe accepted my apology and also agreed that in future if I keep saying no she won't keep trying to force the answer she wants. \n\nSo thanks I guess Reddit.

There are lots of local businesses, a great community, and lots of connections and interactions between groups of people/areas. \n\nUntil recently I worked for a local business which is a specialty store in an subject area where I have particular knowledge and skills. I was hired two years ago by an awesome older lady - she trained us to do most of the store tasks: ordering, creating displays, social media, running events and community groups, etc on our own. This was great until she sold the business and retired. \n\nThe new owner is a retired government drone (I'll call her Karen), WASP, micromanager, and in way over her head. She has a habit of changing how we do things impulsively , which causes issues, then sending passive-aggressive emails, misreading stuff and blowing up at people over these issues, and just generally not cool behaviour sometimes. She had high standards for us, but hey, her store, her prerogative. I didn't work the same days as she was in, so not a big deal for me, and her outbursts usually blew over fast and I could avoid the worst of it. \n\nHowever, a couple weeks ago there was an incident at the store Karen felt we didn't handle well, and she sent multiple angry, accusatory, and passive-aggressive emails, texts, and a voicemail. In one email about 12 hours after this incident Karen berated my shift parter and I for not apologizing immediately for our role. \n\nI'd had enough and sent an email back saying, pretty politely and calmly (coworkers vouched for this) that, a) I was not ok with how she was handling this (way of accusing us, sending multiple emails and texts, her tone), b) the one berating email particularly was not helpful for figuring out what happened in the incident and how to rectify it with my coworker and I, and c) I was not going to engage with the angry behaviour over email and we could talk about it in person the next day. She emailed back a really angry response immediately, at the end of which she fired me. No warning, no acknowledgement of the issues I raised except to say I was being ridiculous. Ok, fine, good riddance, and I'm moving on. Maybe I deserved it for getting involved.\n\nThe WIBTA issue is this: I need to get another job in the same neighbourhood, among business owners who know Karen and the store I used to work at.

I'd spend on Uber to my door rather than walking home and I changed my phone number.\n\nI then really wanted to wipe my life clean of this guy so I started getting everything appraised and sold. It turned out to be just over 50k, and I decided to pay off the last of my student loans and put the rest into retirement savings and other long term investments, because it would be a huge weight off my shoulders to not have as much worry about my finances for the future.\n\nIt also helped me feel like after everything, I'd made a good change. I hadn't let myself stay in a relationship where I was treated less like a human and more like a toy, and I had made a responsible choice for myself.\n\nBut the backlash of that was that somehow word got around to him, and he was putting me on blast on (public) social media, saying I had squirred away over 100 thousand dollars in gifts and then ghosted him. \n\nIt freaked me out because I wanted no contact at all, and felt like he was trying to provoke me. Plus I was mad that he was using my name online when having a clean online presence is very important to me. If I Google myself I would see exactly two things that are about me: my listing in my company directory that says my name, job title and email, and a mention in my grandmother's obituary. And you have to go to page three of Google to even find those.\n\nBut now my name and all this is all over the internet?\n\nI also have had some friends tell me it's low of me to not return stuff, this is not like a normal breakup, this stuff had been worth more than my yearly salary.\n\nAITA for selling it all?\n        ",

That was good and she made the effort a few more times to see me, so I saw some possibility in us being a \"thing\".\n\nMy biggest fear in a relationship is getting a girl pregnant too soon. I've always been a fan of using condoms even if it kills the vibe. When I brought it up this time, she said not for me to worry because she had her tubes done and it was \"literally impossible\" for her to get pregnant. \n\nI should also add that she is a medical doctor so when she makes a claim about her body, I tend to trust her expert opinion.\n\nFast forward a couple months and we have some over the top fight and she says she can't do this anymore. I say ok and we part ways in what I think is a civil break up, despite the break up period (over the weekend of Valentine's day, no less) being absolute soul bending torture. I couldn't say or do a damn thing right and any action or word I did use ended up getting twisted into something that was the opposite. Last thing she says to me is \"don't ever contact me again\"\n\nI'm a bit of a sensitive dude and know that this was out of character for her so I feel something is wrong. I text a few times to get nothing back, just to make sure she's ok and that she's not got bigger issues.\n\nShe finally texts me telling me she's got an ectopic pregnancy and needs to get an injection to terminate. Im a bit blown away because she told me it was impossible to get pregnant and sure enough it happens. \n\nI try my best to say supportive things like \"you got this\" and \"I'm sure you'll be well taken care of\" and try to cheer her up to no avail. \n\nThe next few weeks were hell with her constantly harassing me and saying extremely mean things about myself and my character. She says that when we broke up she was obviously hormonal with the pregnancy and I should have thicker skin, and a \"real man\" would have been supportive to her through this difficult time.\n\nI and a few other people aren't even sure if she did get pregnant and maybe wonder if it was a tactic to try and get me back.\n\nAnyway I ended up blocking her and she moved to email, sending hate filled messages about me not rising to the occasion to take responsibility for my part in the pregnancy.\n\nI just kept ignoring her.\n\nAITA?\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for outing my cousin to my uncle after she stole and ruined my expensive liquor? | Happened earlier this year when our uncle was visiting us.\n\nSo a few years back, my cousin (17 at the time) and a friend of hers (18 at the time) traveled about 400 kilometers for a music festival which lasted several days. During this time they stayed at my parents place, where I still live. I was the only one at home during this time as my parents and my sister were away for the week. Upon my parents insisting, I slept in their bedroom and let my cousin and her friend sleep in my room. Bad idea.\n\nAfter the music festival had ended I gave them a ride to the train station and went back home to clean up a bit before the rest of the family comes home. I noticed bottles on my liquor shelf had been shifted, they were a mix of different variations of apple coqnag/brandy, with the cheapest of them being 75\u20ac per liter. The most expensive one was 200\u20ac per liter and I had a half a liter bottle of it.\n\nKnowing that I too had been 17 at one point my life I had a creeping suspicion that the girls had stolen some of my liquor. I popped open the expensive one, and with one taste I could tell it was watered down. I was absolutely furious, I knew my cousin was spoiled rotten but going as far as stealing from family was too much. If she wanted to have a drink before going to the festival she should have asked me and not stolen from me. \n\nWhen my parents came home I confronted them about this and insisted we call my uncle and tell him what had happened, my dad didn't believe me and took my cousin's side in this matter. I dropped the subject after my dad surprised my with a similar bottle a few weeks later when he came from a work trip. I provided him with a taste sample of the diluted coqnag and the new bottle he had bought and he too noticed the difference but did not want to start an argument with his brother/extended family.\n\nA year or two later my uncle and the cousin in question came to visit us, I was doing some schoolwork and joined their company a bit later. My uncle asked why I had been locked up in my room and I just jokingly said that I was hiding the liquor. He asked what I meant by that and I tried dodging the subject since it was already solved on my part. He kept pushing and asking about it so I told what had happened when my cousin last stayed at our house and my uncle was fuming. They left shortly after, my uncle thanked me for telling him about it but inquired why I had kept my mouth shut. I just told him that I was underage not too long ago. \n\nBut the problem is, my parents consider me to be a major A-hole in this matter. They didn't even remember this whole thing happening and they couldn't believe how petty I was to hold onto a grudge like this. The problem is that this subject is always brought up in a discussion when we have a disagreement with my parents and they start saying stuff like *\"MorriCC is so petty he'll probably remember for a decade/I hope you don't go snitching about this like you did with \\[cousin's name\\]\"* and so on.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not staying overnight with my wife in the hospital? | This happened a long time ago but came up because my mom is going to have minor surgery and is supposed to be in the hospital over the weekend.\n\nMy wife comes from a large family and for the most part they are incredible. However, one of their quirks is they feel that if one of them is in the hospital someone HAS to be there, ALL THE TIME. I learned about this when my mother-in-law had knee surgery and my wife and her siblings were making a schedule of who would be there every minute of the day. I told my wife I thought it was odd but she thought I was crazy for NOT thinking someone should be there all of the time.\n\nThe other day my wife asked what our plan was for this weekend. She said she wanted to  go to the local Christmas parade Saturday morning but was afraid that we wouldn't be able to go. I told her it shouldn't be a problem and I assured her that my mother would be ok if we didn't visit her until afternoon and joked not everybody was as odd as her family.\n\nThat's when it all came out. Apparently my wife is still a little salty that I didn't stay in the hospital with her when our first child was born!\n\nIn early February, 2000, my wife was pregnant and two weeks passed due. Her doctor scheduled her to be induced and we were supposed to be at the hospital at 630 AM. Of course, neither of us could fall asleep the night before until almost just before we had to get up. At eight that night, with no signs of our daughter coming,the Dr decided to call it a night and start again in the morning. At the end of a very long day, with both of us working on less than 3 hours of sleep, we were both completely exhausted. I sat with my wife until we both dozed off and woke her and told her I was going to go home and get some sleep.\n\nThe next morning I was back at the hospital before 7 AM, at 8 they started trying to induce her again. Eventually the Dr decided to perform a c-section. I was in the OR with my wife during the birth and we spent that evening with our newborn. After midnight I kissed them goodnight and went home to sleep.\n\nI returned the next morning and spent most of next day at the hospital with my wife and daughter entertaining visitors. I did leave when my mother-in law was there for a few hours to get some lunch and decompress. That night I left after everyone was asleep to make sure the house was ready and returned the next morning to take my wife and daughter home.\n\nApparently, the fact that I left to sleep was an issue. My wife never said anything to me then, but it bothered her for years. It wasn't until we talked about their schedule for her mom's surgery that she realized 1.not everyone expected someone to be there in the hospital with them 24/7 and 2.I had no idea she was expecting me to stay the night.\n\nI don't think I did anything wrong but it does bother me that I may have caused my wife pain so I have to ask, twenty years ago, was I the asshole?\n\n\n\nUpdate for Clarification:\nWell this blew up overnight. At the risk of breaking the rule about arguing I would like to clarify a few things. I can accept the judgement of asshole but a lot of the reasoning is stating \"facts\" that just aren't true. From some of what I've read it sounds like I did a slow roll by the hospital and kicked my pregnant wife out of the car and went home and chilled until it was time for them to come home.\n\nI've been called a horrible husband and father, it's been suggested my wife should have divorced me, been compared to an abusive ex, vilified for waking her up to let her know I was leaving, vilified for not waking her up to let her know I was leaving, accused of leaving my wife alone in the middle of labor, abandoning her in the midst of emergency surgery and several more very shitty things.\n\nSo to clarify some things that were edited out because of character limits. The first day we were sent home at 630 because they had a bunch of natural deliveries come in the night before. They called us back that afternoon and attempted to induce labor but my wife was NOT in labor that night. They stopped the inducing drugs and the decision was made to start trying again the next morning. They gave her something to help her rest and several hours later we both were dozing in and out of sleep. I only left after a nurse suggested we both needed to get some rest for the next day and hinted several times I should leave. When the nurse came for a vital check and mentioned again we both needed to get some rest I told my half awake wife I would go so she could sleep. She said okay but never said anything about wanting me to stay. I was gone that night six hours max and my wife was still asleep the next morning when I got back.\n\nDay two, induction started early but labor never came. After the c-section, we spent several hours together with the baby. Later that night, again, at the suggestion of the nurse that we both needed to get some rest, I said something about leaving so she could sleep. My wife said ok and didn't say anything about me staying the night. I sat with her until she fell asleep, checked in at the nursery where my daughter was asleep and went home for about five hours.\n\nDay three I was at the hospital all day except when I stepped out when my MIL was there. Both mother and baby were doing great and the doctor said they would be released the next morning. I left that night after midnight again to make sure we hadn't forgotten any baby things and to install the car seat. Talked to my wife about leaving and she never said anything about wanting me to stay the night. I sat with her until she was asleep, checked in at the nursery and went home.\n\nI had no idea she had any expectation of me to stay. I didn't even know that was an option. I was nervous about being there after visiting hours as it was. 20 years ago fathers were still treated more like a nuisance than a partner.\n\nIt wasn't until several years later that my wife told me about how her grandfather hated and was terrified of hospitals and insisted that someone be with him every second he was there. That has carried over to everyone in her family but I didn't know this until even later when her mom had surgery. It was only when we were talking about her mother's visiting schedule that I realized her family felt this way and she realized not every body expects a hospital chaperone 24/7.\n\nAgain, call me an asshole if you will but please do so based on facts instead of assumptions. I would have slept on the floor if my wife had asked. I just didn't know it was expected or allowed.\n\n\nUpdate Part 2\nI fully expected to be called an asshole BUT I am honestly surprised by the amount of hateful comments I've received. I've been called some things I've never even heard of and some I have. My favorite so far is a \"bag of dicks.\"  Either way, it's been a good way to kill the time while my mom is in surgery\n\nFor everyone saying I should apologize to my wife, I did, years ago. When we were discussing her mothers surgery schedule and realized we came from such different places I asked her did that mean I was supposed to be there 24/7 when she had the kids. She said not with the second two because I was watching the other one, then two. But for the first child, yes, I should have and she was upset that I didn't stay. I apologized and asked for forgiveness because I had no idea. She said she realized I didn't know and said she understood and forgave me. The only reason it came up and I made this post is when we were talking about my moms surgery, my wife made a joke about staying the night. I know she was joking but after 22+years I could tell there was a little something behind the joke. If I only knew then what I know now.   For the record---I have absolutely no feeling that she is the asshole, we didn't communicate very well but she is definitely NOT the asshole here.\n\nThe other common comment is a mocking \"Poor baby was tired and had to go sleep in a comfy bed while his wife suffered alone.\" I seriously think you guys are overestimating how long I was gone each night, but OK. The longest I was away from the hospital was for less than 6 hours on the first night and my wife literally slept the whole time I was gone.  By the time I drove home (30 minutes), checked on and fed the cat, was able to fall asleep, got up, showered, got ready and drove back I actually slept about three hours that first night and about two hours the next two nights. I honestly probably would have gotten more sleep if I had stayed at the hospital. \n\nI left because I thought I was supposed to, not because I wanted to. Also, I didn't know I even could stay. Several have mentioned that 20 years ago was not that long ago and husbands everywhere had been staying the night but that was not the case in my experience. We had three kids in the same hospital, when our third child was born in 2003, the nurses offered me pillows and a blanket and made it clear that it was OK to stay the night. In 2000 and 2001 the nurses never said anything about staying, I don't know how many times I heard the same speech at the desk, in the room, from other rooms, in the hallway, \"Visiting hours are over at 10. Everyone has to be out by then except dad who can stay a little while longer ...if mom wants him around, that is.\" but every nurse on the floor said the same thing both of the first two times we were there. I know I'm an idiot but honestly at the time I had no idea you could stay overnight in the hospital, I thought that was why they had visiting hours.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the ride, I know I'm the asshole! Also, thanks to the people who messaged because they knew their not asshole comments would be buried and that was the only way I'd see them. The words of the sympathetic mothers, midwives and nurses were very appreciated.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for choosing to tell my mom about my pregnancy/miscarriage the day she is hosting my sisters bridal shower? | Hi Reddit,\n\nThis week has been a doozy. On Sunday after noticing I was late I took a pregnancy test and saw that it was positive. I went to the doctor on Wednesday to get bloodwork done which confirmed I was pregnant. On Thursday night I started to have some cramping and spotting and panicked that it might be a miscarriage since they\u2019re quite common early on. After work on Friday I went directly to the emergency room and was there for over 10 hours while they performed a million tests on me and told me that I was indeed miscarrying and not just that, I have a rare blood issue that can cause me to potentially mount an immune response attacking future pregnancies. It was an incredibly rough night. My sisters bridal shower is at my parents house today and I had told my mother I would come home on Friday to help set up, obviously I did not anticipate being at the hospital for over 10 hours and didn\u2019t make it home and got a few angry texts from my mother asking where I was. I felt ashamed and upset and wasn\u2019t ready to let people other than my boyfriend know what was going on. I decided to head home early this morning to try to help with the last of the setup. Knowing that I\u2019m still in the process of miscarrying and it may cause issues today (needing to lay down because of the pain/nausea) I decided I should sit my mom down and explain why I had been MIA and why I may not be as present today (since I am my sisters maid of honor and should be there all day). I explained to her what had happened and she looked upset/disgusted with me. She didn\u2019t ask if I was ok. Didn\u2019t offer up a hug or support. And basically told me to go upstairs so I was out of the way until I was ready to run errand and help. She lied and told everyone I had food poisoning and people started coming up to me with concerned looks asking if I was ok. I figured she told and in private I went off on her telling her to just stop talking about me and just stay out of it. \n\nI can\u2019t decide if AITA for choosing to tell her now when she\u2019s about to host a bunch of people?\n\nEdit: she came to check on me while I was upstairs handling a work emergency. I blew her off because I\u2019m hurt and honestly didn\u2019t want to deal with it and really did need to handle the work emergency. In my eyes waiting 5 hours to finally check on me at a point where the house is full of people I don\u2019t want to broadcast this to was unacceptable. I\u2019m still hiding out upstairs for a few minute breather.\n        ",

One cousin didn\u2019t respond and so I called the other cousin (they live close to each other and I\u2019m about 45 mins away).  She said she would talk to other cousin so we could figure it out.  The available Saturdays are Sep 28, Oct 5, Oct 12, and Oct 19.   I can\u2019t do it on Sep 28 because hubby has to work until 7.  I can\u2019t do it on a Sunday because there will be lots of Zack\u2019s friends over for a sleepover in addition to family. So...rather than discussing it with me, after my cousins discussed it together, they texted me saying that Everett\u2019s 1st birthday party would be on Oct 5th, and Trent\u2019s party will either be Oct 12 or 19, depending on if the venue is available.  So I feel like they have pretty much hijacked every available weekend, and I\u2019m supposed to just sit and wait until I know if Oct 12 or Oct 19 would be available.  Well, I can tell ya that my soon to be 12 yo would not be happy if I told him he had to wait until the 19th since his birthday is on the 2nd.  So I just planned his party for October 12 and said f*ck those girls.  Maybe I should have waited to see when Trent\u2019s party was going to be and had it on the opposite weekend in October and just told my son to suck it up if ended up being 17 days past his birthday.  I don\u2019t really care, but what I care about is my son being disappointed.  He\u2019s not spoiled, but I do make a big deal of his birthday. \n\nSide note: my family has made planning Zack\u2019s birthday parties a nightmare every year, so I may also be low on patience. One year at the last minute my mom \u201cwasn\u2019t sure if she could come because her boyfriend\u2019s family was having a get together\u201d...her boyfriend who was pretty much her roommate (no hanky panky for like 5 yrs so it pretty much ended up being a living arrangement)...and she is no longer with him now.  One year no one came because of a fundraiser I knew nothing about and that ended up landing on the same day as the party.  Also, Everett\u2019s parents never come to Zack\u2019s birthday parties anyway...instead his mom\u2019s parents (my aunt and uncle) come.  I don\u2019t want to cause a rift in the family but I\u2019m just at the end of my rope. \n\nSuggestions?\n\nEdit: To add, because I\u2019ve seen many posts saying he should have a kids\u2019 party and don\u2019t worry so much about the adults, but he is only inviting two friends.  One is a boy who will stay overnight and the other is a girl who will stay just for the party.  My son is kinda shy like me.  But I sincerely appreciate everyone\u2019s responses!  I really needed more perspective.\n        ",

I put my foot down and said that I love her, and that the type of relationship i have with her comes once in a lifetime.

I say I hate the way you're acting.

I felt like I was doing a good job answering the questions, and they asked me about a challenge that I had overcome. I had a roughly prepared answer, and it went smoothly.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for refusing to take custody of my niece (11) while my grandmother passes away? | Okay so my grandmother (85) has been admitted in hospitals about 5 different times in the last two years. She\u2019s pulled through amazingly each time but this time it doesn\u2019t seem like it will be the same. She had two heart attacks back to back and at first seemed like she was going to be okay but took a turn for the worse over the weekend. There was a moment where she was conscious and expressed that she\u2019s tired and she wants to die. She no longer wants to keep suffering and is at peace with it. It hurts to hear but we get it. She was intubated because her breathing was failing and the doctor said we would give it until Monday to make a final decision.\n\nNow the problem is that my grandmother has custody of my niece who has been staying with my aunt while she\u2019s been hospitalized because it\u2019s just a lot more convenient. My aunt lives in my niece\u2019s school district and has a young daughter that is basically my niece\u2019s other half. My aunt is a wonderful woman but she is tough in a healthy way. She doesn\u2019t put up with BS and is very family first (her kids and husband). We all know that my aunt will not stay with my niece for the long run which is fine. My mother says she will step up since \u201cshe can\u2019t abandon her granddaughter\u201d this means my mother will come from her home country to the US to take care of my niece. (Niece\u2019s mother is not able to have her right now because of mental health issues)\n\nAnother problem is my mother wants to come after my grandmother passes to take the body back to their home country and she expects her sister to go with her. She wants me to take care of my niece which I wouldn\u2019t have a problem doing so except she gets out of school around 4PM and I\u2019m already on my way to my school at 3PM and wouldn\u2019t get back home until close to 10PM two days out of the week and then two other days I leave for school at 6PM and get back at the same time so I literally can\u2019t watch her. I tell my mother this and she says it\u2019s just for a short while until she gets back to the US. I explain to her that I can\u2019t again and she goes \u201cokay I know I can\u2019t count on you\u201d and then says \u201cthis is an emergency I\u2019ll talk to her father and see if he can take her anywhere\u201d. The problem is that the father is hot garbage juice. He leaves her alone almost all day while I assume he\u2019s making drop offs because he sells weed because he refused to get a real job in order to not pay child support. He\u2019s mentally and emotionally abusive and belongs in a dump yard.\n\nMy issue is that for two days I don\u2019t mind leaving her alone for a few hours while I\u2019m at school but I don\u2019t like the idea of her coming home to an empty house and going to bed alone basically spending her whole day alone outside of school on the other two days. She\u2019s a great kid and really needs to feel the warmth of a family which my husband and I can\u2019t give her until the semester is over and I can rearrange my classes.\n\nAITA for saying no to my mother?\n\nUPDATE:\nHello again, I just wanted to thank everyone for their thoughts, opinions and judgements regardless of what was said. \n\nSo the solution that was agreed upon is that niece will stay with the aunt she\u2019s been staying with. Her husband and her talked it out amongst themselves and decided why move her when it\u2019s all so convenient for everyone. Niece gets out at 4PM daily and cousin gets home by 3PM daily so cousin will be home before niece. My uncle will also be around as he gets home around 4PM so they will both be supervised for a few hours until my aunt gets home from the hospital. \n\nAs far as my mother, at first I decided to just leave her alone and not text her cuz she really hurt me and put me in a tight spot without it having to be. I quickly changed my mind though because she\u2019s hurting and grieving and I\u2019m losing a grandmother but she\u2019s losing her mother and idk what my mind will be like when that time comes for her. I don\u2019t hold it against her since we\u2019re all very emotional and she just basically wants me to be her proxy but she doesn\u2019t understand that I\u2019m not there yet. I\u2019m not ready to make decisions on her behalf that affect the whole family. Quite frankly it\u2019s just not my place. \n\nThe superstar of all this though is my aunt. She\u2019s been strong for everyone in my family. When she saw us getting emotional around grandma she took us to the side individually and helped us do breathing exercises so we wouldn\u2019t upset grandma in her final moments. She made sure ALL of the grandkids were together when grandmother was extubated and we surrounded her bed making jokes and having grandmother cuss at us cuz we kept saying the only inheritance she\u2019s leaving us is our smelly feet and hairless legs up until the moment we found a single black hair on her leg and then the laughter really ensued. \n\nShe\u2019s still with us for the moment and we will continue to make the best out of the most painful stage in this shitty cycle called life. \n\nAlso we had the most amazing nurse like BEST NURSE HANDS DOWN! Nominate your nurses for a Daisy Award if you feel like you\u2019ve received exceptional treatment. We nominated ours and gave her a thank you note because she really is an angel. Some people are just born with an innate ability to comfort people and our nurse is one of them. She was attentive, kind and warm. We even asked to see if she\u2019s like that with all her patience and the answer yes so we nominated her. \n\nThank you all again! Godspeed.\n        ",

She applied to Boston U ED and got in, and ever since she got in, she constantly brags about it- on Insta, on snapchat, and even in person, which is just insufferable. Like, if you got into a school you think is a good fit for you and all that, props. But when you have to tell everyone every five minutes, especially when it's not that great of a school to begin with, it gets annoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I say it's not a super great school, I'm not pulling stuff out of my ass, I've done research. Boston U was on my list of schools I was going to apply to if I was rejected or deferred by my No. 1 choice in ED. And it was a safety, for good reason- it has a low-is admissions rate (29%), but that's really deceiving- the low acceptance rate is due to a *lot of people,* qualified or not, applying to it rather than it actually being competitive for people who had the stats. The average GPA and SAT for those admitted isn't that high- 3.7 and 1400, which is pretty easy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's really part of what has annoyed me about Lauren's bragging- first, it's annoying and kind of pretentious to flex your college acceptances on people. And while it still would be douchey to do so, if she had gotten admitted to an Ivy, Stanford, MIT, or a college of similar caliber, at least their bragging would have merit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the next time she started bringing it up (in the most annoying way possible- literally, she said, 'when I'm in Boston next year, cause y'know I'm going to Boston University, I'll be ....') to me, I just straight up told her it was really annoying for her to keep trying to flex on everyone, and nobody gives a shit. She tried to pull the 'but it's a good college, I deserve to be proud', but I pointed out a) being proud is different than bragging and b) no, it isn't even that great of a school. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis caused her to get upset at me and call me a 'rude dick'. I don't see I'm the rude one as opposed to the girl who's literally trying to flex on everyone with her slightly-above-average college acceptances.\n        ",

I stick with it because quite frankly that's just how I am I find something I really love and am slow to deviate from it. Plus I have long hair that holds color extremely well and for extended periods of time where I only need to get touch-ups every 3 months.  I loved my hairstylist however recently I and my bf (33m) moved to a smaller area/city two months ago. So I had to start the process of finding a new stylist and salon to go to. \n\nBefore I left I made sure to have my former stylist write down exactly what products were used in my hair, the formulas, and the techniques. I figured that it would make my new stylist's life easier and that way I would be happy with the way my hair looks. It may seem petty but on average for my hair length, I spend upwards of 150 USD to 220 USD depending on what needs to be done when I go in. I feel if I am going to pay for something in one go for that much and it's not like just getting a bad haircut that will grow out in a couple of weeks then I should be pleased with it. Plus I'm the one that has to be happy looking at it in the mirror every day. \n\nI found a local salon last week that had great reviews online. I called to double-check to make sure they were able to do what I wanted and used the same type of products. Everything checked out so I made an appointment. I brought with me pictures of how my hair has always turned out, my previous stylist's notes, and explained exactly what I wanted to the stylist. She said it would be no problem and we got started. \n\nRight off the bat, she started doing it differently, I commented on this but she assured me the way she was doing it was a better way and would get the same results. Ok NBD figured she's the cosmetologist. She took me back to their dying station where there were no mirrors for me to see the progression, and the color didn't look the same mixed up as I've seen it in the last 15x I've had this done. I commented again and she said not to worry. \n\nWell after two hours and my constantly asking questions and pointing out things the color was not right. Not even remotely close to what I wanted you couldn't tell the difference between the two colors I had her place in my hair. She kept saying it was the light I would see the difference outside. And nope no difference I of course was upset and requested it be corrected with a new stylist. The owner got involved and said they would happy to do that but I would need to pay for the products used when they do so. I told them no I would not because I gave detailed instructions and made sure the whole process was as simple as freaking possible. Their stylist didn't follow them. \n\nMy BF thinks I'm overreacting he thinks it still looks nice albeit different. And that I'm being a demanding AH.

I grew up in this community, and thus have a pretty good feel for its customs. Generally speaking, families help each other shovel snow if they're able, especially if they have a snowblower.\n\nAll through last winter I've kept with this custom with the neighbor with whom we have a connected driveway. I say connected driveway, though the neighbours are very adamant that it's two separate driveways. Early on this was somewhat contentious, but eventually we came to respect their property to the point we always inform others to park on the street when visiting us. \n\nThat being said, I'm an able-bodied young man whose relatively in shape, so I don't mind shoveling their driveway if it's nothing too deep, and even when it's deeper I'll do it somewhat begrudgingly. I don't have a snowblower, so this adds up to a lot of time snd effort December through April. They've never said thank you, or even said a kind word to our family other than to say my daughters outfit was cute derisively when she was wearing a tutu. This sticks in my partners craw more than it does mine, especially given that they aren't particularly nice or appreciative of free physical labour.\n\nThis past weekend my province got hit with a massive snowstorm, 96cm and ~150km/h winds packing it all down, which resulted in military personnel being called in to aide anyone requiring assistance during the state of emergency declared by the city. Over the past few days people have shoveled out their own driveways, and if able to have helped others. I shoveled mine on my own before anyone was free to help me (approx 8 hours of shoveling), and then helped my neighbor across the street before her son walked down with his snowblower to finish it off. I can't stress how much snow this really is when accumulated from the wind, and it really made me too tired physically to shovel my neighbours driveway again, especially for someone so ungrateful.\n\nMy neighbours are fully able to do it themselves, as evidenced by them having done their own before I've woken up on a few occasions over the past two years. They have not been out shoveling their own driveway at all.\n\nI feel like the asshole because the part of my community I take pride in is that sense of community I'm now ignoring. But at the same time, I feel like I have no obligation to help them because they've disengaged from me as part of the community and it's literal hours of physical labour for people that don't appreciate it. I'm genuinely conflicted as to whether or not I should help them.\n\nSo, in brief, AITA?\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for being mad about my girlfriend dying her hair, again? | Some backstory, this girl LOVES dying her hair. When I met her it was green. Since then it has been teal, blue, black, brown, blonde, red, pink, purple, multicolored, white; pretty much every color and shade I can think of outside of oranges. She\u2019s a real life Romona Flowers, minus all the evil exes. \n\n\nThe first reason she loves dying her hair is because she wants to be a hairdresser, and looks at this process as a sort of interest and practice for this. The second reason she does it is because she gets \u201cbored\u201d of a hair color after about a week or two and will want to change it. \n\n\nI don\u2019t hate the concept of dying your hair, I\u2019ve even done it myself twice in the past to non-contemporary colors. I don\u2019t believe in any of that nonsense such as \u201cpeople who dye their hair are just looking for attention\u201d or anything like that. \n\n\nThe first reason I don\u2019t want her to dye her hair is because since the beginning of our relationship about a year ago, she\u2019s wanted to grow her hair out. In the beginning she had shaved sides and enough up top to barely tie it up. It\u2019s been cut once along the way to deal with some damage from all the dyeing, and now it\u2019s around that short hair for girls, but medium long hair for boys range. The more she damages her hair, the more she\u2019ll have to cut it. We both want her to grow her hair out longer, her more so than I even. It frustrates me that she doesn\u2019t see how counterintuitive it is to keep bleaching and dyeing your hair, then having to get it cut. She could have shoulder length or longer by now had she quit this habit. \n\n\nThe second reason I don\u2019t want her to dye her hair is because I feel that a lot of the colors she chooses are unattractive or tacky. Bright hot pinks, dull barfy greens, ultra light blues, whatever. I think midtown\u2019s or darker colors are better, and overly bright or ugly colors are really meh. I\u2019ve made her aware of my preferences, but she seems to not really care about how I feel. She recently had very dark blue/purple, it looked almost black. This hair color was perfect imo, my second favorite of any color she\u2019s ever had just behind her natural color, a light reddish brown. \n\n\nAnd then yesterday she bleached her hair again, and is looking to dye it some bright light pink color or something like that. She was at a great color, and she could have kept it like that as she grew it out, but she kept it for like not even two weeks. \n\n\nWe\u2019re currently having a tiny spat about it. I wouldn\u2019t call it an argument, hair isn\u2019t the end-all be-all or anything, but we both feel that the other is being inconsiderate. She feels like it is unfair for her to have to not be able to dye her hair just because I don\u2019t want her to or because I wouldn\u2019t like the color. I feel that she should be able to limit the dyeing of her hair in order to reach our mutually shared wish for her to have longer healthier hair, and that she can still dye it every now and then to colors I enjoy. \n\n\nAm I the asshole? Is she? No asshole? Both assholes? Interested to hear the answer.\n\n\nEdit1: It should be noted that she still wants to grow her hair out, that priority hasn\u2019t changed; she\u2019s just not acting in the best interest of that goal. I am also not forcing her any which way, I\u2019m just voicing my frustrations to her which has caused the aforementioned \u201cspat\u201d.\n\n\nEdit2: an additional reason I\u2019m against it is that she doesn\u2019t have the finances to be dyeing her hair. She\u2019s currently unemployed, and I pay for all our dates. She uses her money on snacks, vape pods, and hair dye. No real savings to speak of. She doesn\u2019t have the money for any hair repair kits or such like olaplex either. We\u2019re considering moving in together in the future, and I wouldn\u2019t want to do that with someone who cares more about the color of their hair than having an emergency fund or money for rent.\n\nFinal Edit: Perhaps it was my mistake for using hyperbole with the word mad, but it seems a lot of commenters are making assumptions. Perhaps parts of my story were accidentally misleading, or maybe I left out too much information. This isn\u2019t an ongoing argument that is a super serious crux of our relationship. I\u2019m not repeatedly telling her I hate her hair / etc. in order to control her. I am in no way making any ultimatums to her about this issue, or any other action in an effort to force her to do whatever I want her to do. I understand that it\u2019s her decision, I am only venting a minor frustration on the decision she made. I\u2019m not sure even with all the semantic changes that should be made or additional information Reddit would care though, it seems most feel I don\u2019t even get to have an opinion, so ITA\n        ",

Within a couple months, I was paying his rent, electric, internet, cell phone, and car insurance, PLUS he expects me to pay when we go out and to help him buy things like video games.

I've told him multiple times that I don't earn enough to support two people and he needs to find a source of income, but nothing has changed. My own bills are going into default and collections and I can't afford health insurance because I've been paying for his things. I have no savings. I have no credit. This is ruining me financially.

I'm not sure if he blew it off, or if it really will happen soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason he's not working is he has a physical disability (he needs reconstructive surgery on one of his knees due to a car accident a few years ago) and several mental health diagnoses, including Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD.

I've suggested he apply for fuel assistance and cash assistance and any number of other benefits, but he never follows through and tells me he can't do these things without my help. The only source of income he has is a little over $100 in food stamps. He asks me to supplement his food budget, and also to do things like pick him up fast food and order him pizza.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to tell him I'm not giving him any more money, starting today, but I'm worried that's unfair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm definitely TA for not saying \"no\" the first time he asked me for money.

So what say you?\n\nI went to a big blue box store for a few things with my teenagers. I brought my own bags and used the self checkouts. I also used mobile pay so I don\u2019t have to deal with paper receipts. (That\u2019s basically the only reason I use it, though it is convenient to not have to carry a wallet.) The self checkout station is fairly enclosed, and they have an employee overseeing the customers. They also have cameras at each checkout. Both of these things are for loss prevention, I assume. I purchased a couple of things that didn\u2019t fit in the bags, but I had brought my own bags anyway. As I was leaving, another employee walked up to me and didn\u2019t even say a word, just started looking in my cart and holding out her hand. I knew my rights, so I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need to show you anything. Have a good day.\u201d She tried to stand in front of me and said that it was store policy that people show receipts for unbagged merchandise. (Technically, I guess all of my merchandise was unbagged since I didn\u2019t use their plastic bags.) I pointed to the self checkout I\u2019d used and told her I don\u2019t have a paper receipt since I used their specifically branded mobile pay app. I then told her store policy was not law and walked out to my vehicle. She looked like she wanted to escalate it, but I left without further incident. \n\nIt would be a pain for me to have to pull out my phone, open and wait for the app to load, then pull up the e-receipt. But only a minor inconvenience, though it completely negates the convenience of using the app in the first place.

        "input": "\n        scenario: WIBTA if I prevent my boyfriends sister from getting a much needed job a my company? | My boyfriends sister was let go from a job several months ago. She was a receptionist at a local company and she could not keep up with the demands of the job or execute tasks as they were needed. Before this position she worked in fashion retail for a larger mall chain clothing store. She was there for several YEARS but only ever got got one promotion to seasonal keyholder. \n\nShe\u2019s been applying to a lot of places and she recently informed me that she used me as a reference and applied for an assistant manager position to the fashion retail company that I work for. We are not as wide spread as the old company she worked for but we\u2019ve opened a lot of brand new stores especially in our region. We sell a mixture of clubby clothes for parties and going out, as well as special occasion dresses for homecoming, prom, and weddings. \n\nI am the assistant manager at my store and have a good reputation in my company. I\u2019ve been sent to other stores in our district to assist them and retrain the management teams and sales associates so they run better.  \nI don\u2019t want to vouch for her because I don\u2019t think she would be a good fit but she\u2019s been looking for a job for MONTHS. I also don\u2019t want her to get upset with me if she was to not get the position but I know she\u2019s not prepared for the workload that the job entails.  \n\nWe are in the middle of homecoming season and almost every day is a $15,000 or more day which requires a lot of work from the management teams to accomplish and keep the stores neat and running properly.  Our busy season literally lasts from September to May, because of homecoming season, winter holidays, then prom season.  \n\nWIBTA if I gave my district manager my honest opinion of her capability to handle handle the position, even if I knew it meant she wouldn\u2019t get the job?\n\n\nEDIT: Hey guys! Thank you guys for giving your honest opinions and giving advice on how to handle the situation. I really appreciate it.  \n\nAs a small update today during my shift my district manager came in for a visit and asked about her, as well as the other store she applied to called. I told them both the same thing, that I have never worked with her and did not consent to be a reference for her. \n\nI wanna address some thing in the comments that have been said or asked multiple times tho:\n\n   1. She was not applying for an entry level position. She applied for a management position with no previous history of management experience, and expected me to vouch for her.  \n\n   2. I have been unemployed before. I know the struggle of not having a job.  I was previously employed by Charlotte Russe, a large female clothing company that went bankrupt and I was out of a job for MONTHS.  The difference here is that she is able to be financially dependent on her family. She lives at home and her parents can help her a lot. I have never had any sort of financial help from my family before. \n\n   3. I cannot offer her a job at a different level. She did not apply to my store, nor is it my call to do so that is our store managers job, but we wouldn\u2019t have the same store manager as she would be in a different store, but the same district.  \n\n  4. I am not trying to sabotage her or blackball her from the industry.  I have offered MANY times during her unemployment to review her resumes, edit her cover letters, and help her look for positions she\u2019s qualified and suited for and previously she has turned me down. \n\n  5. I don\u2019t hate her. I will admit for truths sake, we don\u2019t have a wonderful relationship.  We are not close. I understand how the way I worded the original post can make it seem like I was talking down on her or belittling her, I thought her previous work history was an important detail so I added it in. \n\n  6. I don\u2019t take this job as seriously as y\u2019all think. Yes I made this post because I care about my reputation and I care about my standing i. this company. This is because my job is how I afford college. I am on track to get my masters in Biology, and this job funds that. I want to be able to complete my degree and do what I actually love, thus I care about how I am perceived by my supervisors. \n\n   7.  I made this post with the explicit permission and support of my boyfriend, who agrees with me that I\u2019m NTA. He also works in an industry where reputation is vital to the pay you receive, and he has seen how hard I\u2019ve worked to get to a point where I can support myself and pay for my education. He does not want to break up with me because I didn\u2019t lie to help his sister get a job. Also he is not my brother? A lot of people are confusing the relationship. Its my BOYFRIENDS SISTER that used me as a reference. Not my brother, my brothers girlfriend, or my boyfriends girlfriend (lol).\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA For Telling my Friend Why Her Dog was Returned to the Shelter So Often? | Howdy asshole enthusiast, I have a predicament I need some outside advice for.\u00a0\n\n\nBackground info: I (17F) am a senior who's famous for being pretty knowledgeable about animals (going to uni to become a vet). I'm pretty passionate about animal welfare and responsible pet ownership as a result. My friend (18F), \"Gabbie\", is more extreme than me. She's vegan, adopt don't shop (important), animal rights, etc. While I'm a huge fan of purebred dogs and plan to purchase a standard Poodle from a breeder in a few years. A few days prior to this, I was showing her & other peers a few of the breeder's dogs through a group chat, she later made an Instagram post about how gross purebreds are.\n\n\nA couple days ago, she was telling me about the new dog her family adopted and called him over to show me. He was very obviously part heeler. Now, I don't have anything against pitbulls or heelers or mutts, but I know she isn't equipped to handle a combination of two extremely high energy dogs (pits need around 1hr+ of exercise, heelers need 3hrs or more of intense exercise), since she only does 1 20 minute walk a couple times a week with her Chihuahuas.\n\n\nShe began telling me a bit about him, how he had 8 previous owners, death row dog, and how she got him the day before just cause she was bored and wanted another dog. She went on to say how she didn't understand why anyone would return him cause of how sweet and pretty he is. The conversation went like this:\n\n\nMe: Well he looks to be a part Heeler. Very few people can properly care for them.\n\n\nG: I mean, he's a dog. You can't just give him back once you promise to make him a part of your family.\u00a0\n\n\nMe: I don't know. No one should keep an animal they can't properly take care of, that'd be abuse.\n\n\nG: He's a dog. Just give em food, water, a walk or two, and a place to use the bathroom and he'll be fine. Those people should be banned from ever owning an animal.\n\n\nMe: It's not that simple. Some people just aren't equipped to handle certain breeds, that's why they exist. Heelers are pretty difficult.\n\n\nG: Christ why the hell are you so obsessed with designer dogs? I know you want a sparkly new breeder dog, but geez you can settle for a mutt. It's not his fault he was locked in a cell and no one wanted him. It's assholes like you who buy glamor doodle puppies from breeders and leave existing dogs to die.\n\n\nThen she left. I'm not sure exactly what happened after that, since we haven't spoken, but she posted on Instagram today that her parents made her return him. Apparently they overheard our convo, researched heelers and made her take him back, cause now she's telling everyone that I convinced them to \"get rid of him.\" Most of her followers share her beliefs and are calling me an AH.\n\n\nSo Reddit, AITA? Cause now I feel really bad since the pup didn't do anything wrong.\u00a0\n\n\nTLDR; Explained that a friend's dog was a difficult breed, parents made her get rid of it.\n\nEdit: Since everyone's focusing on this, my mom's severely allergic to pet dander, that's why we'd need a poodle. There are 2 poodle rescues near us, but we don't qualify to adopt since we don't have a fenced yard.\n\nAlso, I texted a mutual friend to ask what exactly happened, and apparently the dog kept chewing on the furniture (they had him for 4ish days) even though he had toys. They chocked it up to being \"part of the breed\" and gave him back.\n        ",

It's probably important to note that I'm on the autism spectrum and can have a lot of issues with social cues and understanding cultural expectation type things.\n\nSo, I'm in America but pretty much the only holidays I kind of celebrate are new years, Valentine's, Thanksgiving, and Halloween. Mostly because I'm a really big fan of big meals and I have a sweet tooth. \n\nFor very many years now I haven't celebrated any of my family's birthdays, I haven't done Christmas, no father's or mother's day calls or gifts, etc, but my family always tries to force me into these things and refuses to respect that I don't want to do them. Its a bit that I'm a different religion from everyone else in my family but also just that all of those kinds of days feel really gross to me - just spending money because our culture says we suck if we don't, or calling a relative only because we're expected to, you know? Every year for almost a decade now they still ask what I want for my birthday or for Christmas and I always tell them nothing please it's been (x) years, please just respect this for once. And every year they're always annoyed that I don't want to be around during those kind of holidays for them to give me things and that I don't get them things. It's frustrating as hell.\n\nThey're starting to get more annoyed at me for not doing things like mother's and father's day too. I absolutely HATE doing phone calls and have really bad anxiety on top of just flat not wanting to, but they've tried to push me into calling family and wishing them happy mother's and father's days or calling them on their birthdays but I just really don't want to do it. It's so many awkward phone calls just so they don't think I hate them and so I don't think they're gonna be upset.\n\nBut like, I know that even if I don't celebrate these things they still do, and that to them it feels like I just don't want to celebrate them as a person I guess? AITA for not just participating in the gift giving and talking? How can I get them to lay off of me about not wanting to participate in things?\n\nEDIT for info: With all of the holidays mentioned besides Valentine's I'll go out to their houses and spend time with them then and talk, help cook and clean, and hang out. For Valentine's it's normally just me and my partner and very small things like stuffed animals as comfort items and I'll buy candy for us both because I just fucking love candy. I'll buy candy for us both year round but there's just so much more candy on Valentine's. \n\nI'm a Buddhist convert and the religious objection is a whole thing about the suffering caused by desiring objects and putting value in things that can break or make you feel bad etc, and I try to not even place that much value in the things I have, no matter how expensive. I think I explain it better in a reply I made. Really hard to explain my feelings about it without sounding pretentious I think. Expressing feelings in general isn't my strong suit.\n\nI also mentioned in a reply that with phone calls I'll ANSWER them but really don't make any phone calls and hardly even leave my room if it's not for work and school. I didn't even call any of my friends or family when I was hospitalized for mental health, and not because I didn't wanna talk to them. Everything about phone calls stresses me out - i don't understand what times of day it's okay to call, how many times to try, what to leave in a message if I don't get through, when or how to end a call, etc - but a lot of family has said that just texting this kind of stuff feels rude.\n\nSince it seems like it's agreed that IATA here, at least specifically for mother's and father's day, I really have to wonder exactly how far out into my family I should be expected to do things? In-laws, family members that haven't really treated me or others well, family I barely know, just kind of everyone? I have a really big extended family, not counting in-laws, and feel like it would be unreasonable to get everyone presents or cards or call every single person or remember every birthday even for people I've only met once but who means I wouldn't be alive if they didn't have kids. I also am worried that if I gave concession here they'll take that to mean okay I'm doing everything now, not just this one thing.\n        ",

He's a great dog but he still needs time to adjust. One thing he's not used to yet is peeing in our yard. He needs to go outside the front gate to pee. Because we (mostly I) take him out to pee multiple times a day (he had some incidents), we don't put him on a leash. Instead I just follow him closely. \n\nMost of the time, he just pees on our fence or the lamp post but he LOVES peeing on car tires. When our front facing neighbor's (son's) car is outside, he will cross the street to pee on the tire (it's a small village with minimum traffic, so this is not like dangerous or anything. Plus I'm there). I didn't think much of this. \n\nBut today I was out with him, letting him pee, when our neighbor's son and his wife arrived by car. His wife seemed to look at us weird. Then, later during the day, I was inside my room with the window open, and heard them running after their escaped dog, when the wife, loud enough for me to hear, asked her husband - \"Do you know what dog has been peeing on our car?\"\n\nNow, am I overthinking this, or did she want me to hear this? We live in the countryside, and unfortunately, stray dogs are common. Also other people walk their dogs in our street. So why would this bother her, unless she's sure it's our dog because she saw us today, and she minds us letting him pee on their car?\n\nSo am I overthinking that our neighbor meant to call me out? And if I'm not, am I really the asshole for letting my dog pee on my neighbor's car?\n        ",

When I first set up the chair in our room I told him that it was totally fine for him to sit in the chair and game but my only rule was don't sleep in the chair (I said this because he has a habit of falling asleep in his uncomfy spinny plastic university given chair.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe obliged my request for the first few weeks, eventually though he started to fall asleep in the chair; to which I responded by waking him up and reminding him that I do not want him sleeping in my chair, after which he would make no actions and fall asleep just for me to wake him up again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis went on for months, him falling asleep, me waking him up, him falling asleep 5 mins later, me waking him up again cont. until a few weeks ago I finally snapped and told him how infuriating it is to set clear boundaries only for them to not only be repeatedly crossed but straight up ignored when I reminded him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis helped until today when I found him sleeping in my chair YET AGAIN.

I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused.

It will ultimately be hers and belong to her, we will never see it again nor possess the game. Everyone else responded that they would contribute but honestly I\u2019m reluctant to. I feel like we\u2019re being taken advantage of here and just don\u2019t feel like I should be contributing to something that will never belong to me.

Yeah she said voluntary but it puts pressure on everyone to cough up. I then would feel that I would be expected to bow out as it would be awkward to play with the others knowing that they\u2019d contributed and I hadn\u2019t. This would then mean that the game cannot go ahead due to there only being four players left when it needs 5 but I don\u2019t want this to happen.

I was a middle-of-the-pack student. For an average student like me, I stand little to no chance in landing a tenure-track position even at an \"average\" university. What awaited me was post-doc purgatory and adjunct teaching, where you make a \\*pittance\\* for the amount of education you have invested in yourself. Foreseeing this, I noped the fuck out and jumped to the job market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnter my GF. She is a 28 years old Masters student in engineering. She has informed me on several occasions that she wants to pursue a Ph.D after graduating from her current program. I have been urging her to think twice about this momentous decision. Here are my arguments as to why I think a Ph.D is not good for her:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The Ph.D department she wants to go to is not that highly-ranked. Landing a tenure-track position after graduating from there is a snowball chance in hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. You don't need a Ph.D in engineering to thrive in the professional/industrial job market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. She has never been on the job market. How would she know she wouldn't like it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. I don't think she knows what she's getting into. It's clear she hasn't thoroughly researched this career path. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. She's not that young anymore. Do you really want to use your prime years for an endeavor with highly uncertain payoff? Even if you manage to get a job after, that's \\~5 years of opportunity cost gone. That's \\~5 years in which you could have been working because a Masters is perfectly \\*sufficient\\* already. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. I don't think her personality is good for academia. She is a very quiet and somewhat passive. Teaching, competing for grants, going to conferences, and all that jazz would probably be tough for her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Hell, if the Ph.D is really needed for her next promotion, what prevents her from going \\*back\\* to it after gaining some work experience on the job market first?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost importantly, though, it's that I see myself in her. I believe I was in her shoes 4 years ago. I do not want her to make the same mistake I did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, here's where I could be the asshole:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. She's allowed to do whatever the fuck she wants. Maybe I can give her some (unsolicited?) advice, but it's not my purview to tell her what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. The big one: I'm not that young anymore either. I'm also materialistic. Basically, I don't want a future in which my partner doesn't really contribute to the American Dream because she's still studying as an 30+ years old. If we are to share our life together, I'd want her to work. I'm scared of the uncertainty that her preferred career path brings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause I legit care about her and \\*because I want someone who can help me create the future I want\\*, I've been trying to dissuade her from pursuing her goal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n        ",

If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for the suggestions and help. I spoke with my parents and voiced my concerns. My mom seems to have come to her senses but my dad is still apathetic. I'm packing my bags at crashing at a friend's house until I go back to university. In the long run, I'm not sure what to do. I think a psychiatric ward would be best but there's no way I'll be able to get her to go on my own.\n        ",

She didn\u2019t show her face, but she showed up to the top of her lip, they looked eerily similar, and they had very similar body shapes. I texted my group chat of friends and asked \u201chey, do y\u2019all think this is (let\u2019s call her Emily)\u201d and they said it indeed looked like her. We all joked about how weird it was because she was the LAST girl we expected to post her nudes online, but then that was that.\n\nCome Friday, **everyone** knew about the nudes. She posted very explicit captions and pictures, and all of my (non-friend; more like sports and clubs) group chats literally exploded in her all her posts.

We have three children, aged 14, 11 and 8. A couple of months ago, she began a new 9-5 job as things have been tight financially, and I stressed that it would be important for her to contribute more financially. I travel a lot for my job, so I am gone probably 85% of the time, leaving her to handle everything at home on her own. Before beginning this job, she had been working hard at going to the gym every day, trying to get back into shape. I personally go to the gym almost every day as well, and have for years. \n\nBecause she leaves the house by 7:45 in the morning to drop the younger kids off at school, then works all day, getting home at 6pm, the only time she has to go to the gym is at 5:30 in the morning. Evenings aren't possible as she needs to care for the kids, and prepare their lunches, feed them dinner, etc. She's also quite tired so there isn't really energy to go then. So she's been going before work for the most part. She started out going almost every day, but now she's been missing quite a few days. Today, after coming back into town after being gone for work, I noticed her BCAAs still in the fridge, and I questioned whether she had forgotten them. She told me that she hadn't been to the gym in a few days, and that's why they were still there. So I told her that maybe we needed to chancel her membership if she wasn't going to go anymore. She got very upset and told me that she's doing her best, but she's exhausted, and that she will work out as much as she can. I just don't see the point of paying for a membership if she's not going to use it. AITA?\n\nEdit: I want to add that the reason I have this job is because we moved back to her hometown after 12 years of living in the town I\u2019m from. It was only meant to be temporary( 1-2 years), but it was 12. She never got used to it and was very unhappy, missing her family and wanting more opportunities for the kids. So I agreed to move back to make her happy. She knew this would be the job when we moved(with me away a lot).\n        ",

She\u2019s coincidentally been dating my high school ex who I dated for 3 years between 18-20 (I\u2019m 27 now). It was long enough ago that we\u2019re all on friendly terms and no one really finds it that strange anymore. \n\nMy sis and her fianc\u00e9 still live in our hometown of not that many people. I\u2019ve moved away since I turned 21 and whenever I come home I basically only see my closest family and no one else. I don\u2019t have the best reputation with some of the older generations and I\u2019m fully aware of this.  This is important.\n\nSo the issue I\u2019m now facing is that I truly, desperately do NOT want to see my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents who hated me when we were dating. We had split on terrible terms (it was my fault, I was in a bad place and cheated on him in college) but even tho he doesn\u2019t carry any kind of grudge anymore everyone in town knows his family despises me. \n\nMy sister recently called me about this very topic. She wanted to walk me thru all the tricky pitfalls of interacting with his parents since they still hate me and will probably say terrible things to me in public. She told me that his parents promised to be on good behavior but that I shouldn\u2019t provoke them. But no matter how much I insisted that was a complete lie from them, my sister is still 100% blind to how psychotic and dishonest his parents could be. So I sat on it for a few days thinking about all the crap they\u2019ll end up doing to me and it just ate at me so much I couldn\u2019t sleep for two nights. I talked it thru with friends and my bf and eventually called my sister to tell her that I don\u2019t know what to do because I might not be able to go to her wedding if there\u2019s any chance I\u2019ll be publicly humiliated and verbally abused in front of hundreds. \n\nWell I gently raised this with my sister but she lost it. She said if I miss her wedding then I should just never call her again because she won\u2019t pick up. She thinks I should just suck it up and let his parents do whatever they want to me for her big day. I get where she\u2019s coming from but I also feel like the cost is too high for the sake of my own mental sanity over the next year. AITA?\n\nEdit: to everyone asking why no ones told the parents to behave. The parents are telling my sister and her fianc\u00e9 that they won\u2019t say anything to me and will be perfectly sweet. But I know them well enough to know this is a complete and utter lie. I told my sister as much but she has never seen their nasty side and totally believes them at their word. So now it makes me look like I\u2019m bailing on her wedding for no reason at all even though I know his parents won\u2019t resist talking down to me if they see me.\n        ",

No biggie.\n\nLast night I go down and they're all full but one is finished, and two have <3 minutes in them, so I hang out and wait for all of then to finish.

I'm desperate to finish chores and go to bed so I take out the laundry and put in top of the machines and go about my business.\n\nWhen I come back down (with 2-4 minutes to spare on my machines, because I try not to make others wait for me or make that awkward decision to move it) the other laundry is gone, not in the dryers - score for me!

Ultimately my dad will need to approve the car because he knows far more than I do about them and I trust him.  I was relatively confident that my parents would approve of what I was doing and be happy that I was demonstrating independence, financial responsibility, organisational skills, etc.\n\nI told my mum this afternoon that I had found a car that I liked and that I had placed a deposit on it and received approval for a loan that I would pay off in weekly instalments for five years. Needless to say that she was NOT impressed. I endured about two hours of her alternating between shouting and ignoring me before she took my license off me and basically said that I wasn't content to drive the car I was currently using I won't be allowed to drive at all.\n\nI thought that what I did was perfectly fine considering that I'm an adult, I intend to pay for the car myself and have not asked for a cent from my parents for anything (registration, servicing, gas, etc.) and the fact that I have been saving up for this car for literal YEARS so this certainly shouldn't have come as a surprise.\n\nI graduated as an honour roll student, I've been accepted into university to study medicine (with a substantial scholarship) and I basically haven't stepped a toe out of line in my life.\n\nI honestly don't think I've ever seen my mum this mad and I'm writing this with the threat of \"wait until your father gets home and hears about this\" looming over my head.

My ex died when our son was only 3 months old. I have no family so her parents really stepped up. They helped me with my son, his grandma looked after him while I worked, etc.\n\nNow my son is 5. I got remarried 2 years ago after being in a relationship for over a year. She is the only mom my son knows. He knows about his birth mom, but calls my wife \u201cmommy\u201d and loves her to bits. She\u2019s a SAHM and is great with him.\n\nThe issue lies with my son\u2019s grandparents. They do not like my wife. My wife has been fine with them being in our lives, but they are just awful around her. They make nitpicks about her and get mad at me when I defend her. It\u2019s gotten to the point where they still see my son, but they take him on their own and we\u2019re not around.\n\nRecently, my wife and I have been working on adoption papers so she can legally adopt my son. My son\u2019s grandparents found out and were pissed. I said I wasn\u2019t trying to replace their daughter but that my son loved her like a mom and I wanted us to be a family. They said a bunch of nasty things and then threatened to contest the adoption. I\u2019ve spoken to a lawyer so I know they\u2019d likely lose. But this pissed me off. I said until my son is old enough to make his own choices, they are out of his life. They suddenly got apologetic and said they wouldn\u2019t do it, but I said it was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. They\u2019ve texted me non stop since, saying I\u2019m cruel.\n\nMy ex\u2019s sister texted me and I assured her she could still see him, as long as she doesn\u2019t bring him around them. She said that\u2019s fine but thought I was being harsh, don\u2019t I get their POV? I said while I do, it\u2019s not fair to my wife or my son to go through this. My son hasn\u2019t asked for his grandparents yet but I have so many people in my ear.\n\nAITA here?\n        ",

I don't know why you need a separate pot after all.' She said 'it's not exactly fun for me to have to compete for food. I made the rice and I know there was enough rice in your pot for 3-4 people, and between 3 of you, you did eat all of it. This pot has enough for 1, and I intend to finish it.'\n\nI asked her if she was really gonna make a big deal over rice. She said yes, and now to stop talking about it.\n\nAITA here?

I think that it\u2019s ridiculous that I would have to lower the price, especially since a car that\u2019s been in three accidents isn\u2019t that different from a car that\u2019s been in two.

I met her at the hospital after I finished up with work for the evening and by then they had run all the tests and she was fine. \n\nI don't even know why I bothered showing up. She didn't look very happy to see me and kept saying that she was fine and I didn't have to stay. Of course when her best friend came she was happy to see her.

It was humiliating.\n\nThen at her followup her Dr is still concerned and told my wife to go back to the ER for more tests. I picked her up from her appt and when she told me I put my foot down and said that she could go but she'd have to wait a few hours so I could get my work done. It didn't seem all that urgent but she ended up getting that same friend to take her during her lunch hour. She finally calls around bedtime and says they've discharged her (again she was fine).\n\nI asked her if she could get a ride with someone else because I had the kids and didn't want to get them all in the car for a drive into the city. I even offered to call my sister to come get her. She knows how much I hate night driving, and how stressed I get trying to navigate the city. That hospital complex was a maze. So then she gets pissed and told me that she wasn't going to ask her friend for another ride, that could I please just come get her and she'll put the kids to bed after. \n\nI did end up getting her. But she has been cold to me since. She says that I'm an AH for not taking her in the first place  and for arguing about getting her.\n\nTldr: AITA for not taking my wife immediately to the hospital when I was busy with work and I knew she was fine?\n        ",

I asked my father if he could get them for me and he said yes, but only if I paid him a $100 because I was taking away a lot of his morning. I waited to reply until he brought them to me then said no, I won't be paying you a $100 for doing me a favor. Now, both my parents are ganging up on me saying how ungrateful I always am. I really don't know if IATA or not. They've been saying constantly how ungrateful I act when they do stuff for me. I tell them that you shouldn't ask for things in return when doing service and that I would do the same things as they do if they'd ask.

I can't make exceptions for you since I have another tenant.\n\nQ3: Can the rent be negotiated?\nA3: You have a lot of requests and I don't feel comfortable renting to you anymore.

We got out every weekend (friday night, saturday, sunday) to lunch and dinner together.\n* She has my debit card and I tell her she can spend her days however she likes while I'm at work, she has a car and can go anywhere (we live a city with 1million+ people)\n\nAnyway, onto the problem. Outside of work, I see her 95% of the time, I have maybe 1 hour of alone time a week on the toilet(I'm pretty introverted so this is kinda tough for me, but I know its tough for her too being an extrovert and being alone so I deal). We've had several talks about this over the last few months and i've really limited my free time down to basically nothing. I stopped seeing my father on Sunday mornings to early afternoons because its supposed to be 'our weekend' together according to her. If we make plans on the weekend or weekdays, shes always involved if not the focal point of the plans.\n\nI have a best friend that I want to see 2-3 hours once a week or once every 2 weeks. She says this isn't fair because she has no friends or family, and my life is the same as it was before she got here. I don't think that's true, I think I have also made sacrifices but I really try not to argue with her.\n\nI made plans to see a movie with him later this week, and she seemed okay at first but asked to join us. My friend really likes her and says shes always welcomed so we agreed.\n\nLater that night she seemed down so I asked her to talk to me. She eventually got really upset and started crying about how lonely she is and that I should wait until she has a job and more friends before I see my friend again and she said shes starting to hate him because of the *pressure* he's putting on us.\n\nShe said he should know her situation and he should stop asking to hang out so much.

I have a friend at dance class who brings her 3yo son and I have been becoming concerned over his behaviour and her own mental health. Her son shows some delayed development for example, he is not yet speaking, does not engage/respond with other people - only mum, does not respond to his name, he falls a lot, he will only eat McDonalds, refuses to drink water and is extremely attached to mum that when she leaves the room to use the bathroom, he will begin crying and will take a long time to resettle when she returns. At times, he is unable to resettle and mum will often leave before the class has begun. Her son has been attending the dance studio for almost a year now so it\u2019s not an unfamiliar place. \n\nOne of the other girls who is a student studying early childhood has also expressed concern to me however, she felt it was not her place to say anything as a student. \n\nIn my professional opinion and based on my experience, I believe that my friends son has a developmental delay and he would greatly benefit from early diagnosis and management. By telling my friend about my concerns, I am hoping that she will be able to get the extra support he needs and that this will lead to more positive outcomes in the future for both of them. \n\nMy friend has said previously that she does not know \u2018what\u2019s wrong with him lately\u2019 as well as said she will need to stop dance classes because she needs energy and time to focus on him. I am not sure whether she has seen a doctor or therapist yet for him or if she knows that he needs support. \n\nI am not sure what to do as I do not have children myself and don\u2019t want to come across as if I am saying that there is something wrong with her parenting or her son. I also don\u2019t want to overstep my boundaries as we are not very close friends. \n\nSo WITBA if I told my friend that I am concerned about her son\u2019s development? \n\nTL:DR - A friend at dance class has a son who has shown signs of developmental delay and I think he would greatly benefit from professional support. Should I say something?\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for your responses. It\u2019s been really helpful. I\u2019d like to clarify a few things. The reason I brought up that my friends son only eats McDonald\u2019s was that we see a lot of children with sensory aversions who will not eat certain colours (usually green for vegetables) or textures but will eat fast food. I guess I was putting in my own assumption here that it is possible that he may a have a sensory aversion and that\u2019s why he will only eat McDonalds. However, of course, I would not be certain unless I delved more into it with my friend. Again, I mentioned that my friends son becomes upset when separating from her. We see a lot of children with separation anxiety who miss opportunities of development, growth, socialisation and incidental learning in places like playgroups, childcare and kinder because they become upset when leaving their parent. This again, is an assumption and further assessment would be needed to see if there is something else going on. So I apologise if I sounded judgemental in my post.  Again, thank you all for your responses!\n        ",

We started getting back in touch when my LO turned 1 and things have been alright since. Around this same time i started a new, better paying job that ive been able to advance in and am now making double what i was when my wife and i first married which made us much more financially stable.\n\nForward to about a year ago my mother was saying how they would love to come visit and see LO (who she has only seen in person three times) but since she had lost her job they didnt have the money for her to come see us (about a 4.5hr drive). My wife and I talked and agreed that we would pay for their gas, cook dinners at home and they could stay with us at our house so it wouldnt really cost them anything. I asked her that night and she instantly shot it down saying that they couldnt/wouldnt take money from us and they would just have to wait until they were able. Months pass and i would occasionally extend the offer again and still the same result.\n\nWell yesterday my mom called after work all excited to tell me how my sister (22F) and her husband (?m) had bought her and my SD tickets to fly out and see them (In New Mexico, mom lives in Pennsylvania) in March and paid for all their expenses. She kept going on about how she\u2019s so happy and cant believe sister would do this for her. At this point i was a bit upset/angry so i asked why it was ok to accept sister\u2019s money to visit but not any of our offers? Her response : \u201cWell we figured you wouldnt be too well off after and would be hurting for money.\u201d She then went on to say how its not fair that im angry at something that makes her this happy and i should just be happy for her and im just an ass like my father.

They also found metastasis from the tumor all the way down my spine. I went through chemotherapy and radiation as a result. One possible side effect of the treatment was that I would become infertile. So I had my sperm frozen before the treatment just to be on the safe side and I really did become infertile. \n\nThe problem is that I don't want to have biological children.

My mom and my uncle have also been diagnosed with depression and they think that my grandmother also suffered from it.\n\nBecause of that I decided that I don't want to have biological children. I just don't want to see my children go through the same problem as I did. I know that wouldn't necessarily happen, but I don't want to take any chances.

I told him that being emotionally supportive (and financially, since he can only hold a part time job) demonstrates my love for him. He has depressive episodes pretty much daily, usually lasting hours, during which I hold him, kiss him, make him food, and do my best to be supportive (e.g. telling him that a part time job is better than no job, and that I am proud of him). Depressed as he is, he tells me that I do not make him happy, that he hates his job, life, etc. I should mention that my husband goes to therapy regularly and takes his meds, but nothing seems to work enough to pull him up. \n\nFor me, it is so much work to remain positive and caring and supportive when depression takes over. It takes a lot of energy just to have the same conversations, day after day, about how hopeless everything is, how life is not worth living, etc. It takes a lot of energy to hear \"I am not happy with you,\" and stay strong because you know that's depression talking. Everyday, I see myself putting aside what I would like to be doing with my evening to take care of him. When I confronted with this, his response was that I knew what I was getting into, that emotional support is a core feature of a marriage, and that it does not count as putting him first. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for thinking that taking care of my depressed husband is going the extra mile?\n \nEdit: To answer the question that many of you bring up, yes, I do go to therapy, though more than therapy it feels like me weekly venting. The problem is that, as long as my efforts are not recognized by my husband, I remain selfish in his mind.  \n        ",

First time writing here and non-native English speaker. \n\nI am getting married very soon. As you can imagine, this takes a lot of preparation. I'm talking here about the civil wedding, which will be very intimate and consequently restricted to our very close family: parents, siblings and, in my case, godparents and their children. The wedding will happen in another country, so this takes a lot of preparation as it is in another culture. \n\nWhen I made the invitations, I've been clear: I invited my parents (2 p.) and my godparents' family (4 p.). I've been very flexible, I told everyone that they could join us anytime they like (i.e., arrive in the country when they wish because I understand it's complicated when you have 4 different jobs etc) as long as they'll be present for the ceremony. Moreover, because the destination is far, my in-laws kindly proposed to offer the accommodation to all of them. The wedding is now in one month and I just received a message from my godmother saying that they have booked the flights, and they will be 5 because the gf of my cousin is joining. That's where I am really feeling uncomfortable:\n\nI receive this as a 'fait accompli' (done deal) without any prior consultation, without even asking me if that's ok to have an additional person (that I've never met). I've always been clear about the number of people invited. I just can't stand to receive this kind of 'news' via a late evening text message. It's not that I'm against that additional person. It's just the way that I'm put in front of this, as if I had nothing to say. And we're not talking about the 'party' wedding, but something very special that is meant to be in strict intimacy. Moreover, I know that they have their tickets since 1 month, and I was waiting for their news to plan the trip etc. So they literally waited 1 month to announce it, now that the date is getting closer. I just don't understand this kind of behavior. It costs nothing to make a quick phone call before booking anything, and to ask if it's possible, etc. In sum, they just invited someone at my wedding, someone that wasn't ever planned and that I don't even know.\n\nThis morning, I sent a polite message saying: 'I'm confused by your news, I've always been clear about the number of guests and why I picked these specific guests (i.e. you) for our wedding. Why haven't you called me and asked me before booking anything? I'm put in front of a done deal, and I have to oppose myself to it, as it goes against the very idea of what we've been planning for months. The solution to this situation, I am afraid, does not lie within my hands. If X is feeling uncomfortable about this, I could understand, but with respect to my in-laws, I just cannot accept this compromise.' \n\nSo: Am I the asshole?

I sacrificed everything to give her a quality education and I did everything I could to give her a stable home life. Her father and I stayed together purely because we were thinking of her wellbeing. I sacrificed a lot of time to make sure that she was always on track with her studies and employment so that she would have the best possible start to life. I told her everything I did for her and said that it was she that was unsupportive of me and ungrateful for everything that I\u2019ve done for her. She swore at me and left to go back inside. \n\nI\u2019ve been told by my older sister that I handled this poorly and that I shouldn\u2019t have confronted my daughter during the wake in public, even though I didn\u2019t do this in front of any witnesses. I do acknowledge that I shouldn't have been so emotional so quickly but I also think that it was my daughter who decided to make this public in the first place with her conduct during the funeral.

So let me explain a little bit:\n\nMy brother takes the bus every morning and that bus comes to his bus stop around 7:15am every morning. He has a tendency to miss the bus due to him being very slow to get ready in the morning. Now we live around 3 minutes from the school, but it easily adds up to 5 or even 10 minutes because of the awful traffic that we encounter when getting to school. So the latest we can leave without either of us being late is around 7:20 because the middle school (my brother) and the high school (me) that we respectively go to are across the street from each other. I park fairly far away from the entrance to my school so it\u2019s another 7-10 minute walk to get to my class from my car. So if I leave around 7:20 with my brother, I am able to drop him off at around 7:25, and then I get to my spot around 7:28. And then I finally get to my class around 3 minutes before the bell rings (class starts around 7:40). \n\nSo this morning it was around 7:25 before I even leave the house so I don\u2019t have enough time to take him to school and also not making me late. So I had to leave the house. Then I get a few very pissed off texts from my mother saying how I should have waited around for my brother and taken him to school, even if it made me late to class. \n\nSo I am wondering if I am being an asshole by not waiting for my brother to leave the house, even if it causes me to be late to class? Obviously if we can both make it on time, then I would be more than happy to take him, but it seems like I have to sacrifice my attendance for him being so slow getting ready in the morning.\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\n        ",

I don't mind this because the stairs are right by our front door, so I can avoid awkward conversations by going into our kitchen when her customers are around. I don't do this out of rudeness, I am just not very social.\n\nHowever, my mom recently picked up new customers - mother & her two very autistic sons (both in their early 20s, around 6'2 & probably near 300 pounds - I am 125 lbs & 5'6). I go to public school where there are a lot of autistic students, so I am comfortable around people with mental obstacles & do not have a problem with working with them. \n\n\nHowever, my mother's new customers are violent & very invasive. They have never actually harmed either my mom or myself, but they shake their fists (threateningly) at my mom before she does their hair & yell because they don't want their hair cut. (According to her, once she begins doing their hair they settle down.) One time when I was home, I was sitting in our dining room, which is upstairs and a ways away from our stairs, & all of the sudden I hear footsteps and one of the boys is walking into the kitchen. He asks me for a glass of water. No big deal - I'm often asked to bring my mom's customers a glass of water or a can of pop, I'm used to it & don't really care. I get him a glass of water & he downs it pretty quickly, puts it on the counter, & heads back downstairs. A few minutes later, he comes back upstairs with one of those Ring Pops (a plastic ring with candy on it, for anyone who doesn't know), shows me & tells me that he was going to marry me. I was slightly taken aback, & he insisted again. This made me uncomfortable, & I made some remark (kindly) along the lines of, \"I can't marry you, I'm still in highschool!\" He kept insisting until his mother came upstairs and they left. \n\nThe most recent time they were here (2 days ago), he saw me when he came in the door & immediately started talking about marrying me. No specifics, just referring to me as his wife, etc. I grew more uncomfortable, but he went downstairs and I shook it off. While they were downstairs, I was in the dining room again doing homework. I hear footsteps coming up the stairs, but this time they dont come towards me. I wait a few minutes, & then go see what he's doing. He is standing in the doorway of my bedroom, just looking around. I know for a fact my door had been closed. My level of discomfort rises significantly. My mom tells me that when they get their hair cut & I'm not home, he asks about me constantly - my mom is under the impression that I'm okay with it, she is not TA as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI would like to talk to my mom & ask her to have a conversation with the mother about not bringing them to our home anymore because it makes me very uncomfortable. I don't think the boys are intentionally making either of us uncomfortable, but I am worried about our safety. \n \nSo WIBTA?\n        ",

Now in the middle of the semester when I went back home for one week (like a winter break) on the first day a fight broke between my parents (48M) (44F)and apparently my dad had another woman in his life other than my mom (not the first time btw), and on that week all hell broke loose. within 2 weeks my mother wanted to separate quietly but my dad wanted custody and my mom didn't agree, so my mom files a law suit for the divorce and in this whole time my dad is denying all this and saying that my mother is hallucinating (but he doesn't know that my mother has evidence on him and not planning on telling him until the day of the hearing which really makes arguing impossible).\n\nNow i'm living in a lively city, its like the newyork of my country and i love it, i just met a girl im in love with and its been going great, i'm taking latin dance lessons and it really helped me take my mind of all this, my friends are here, the job potential is better here, my workout routine is set here, my network is here, everything that matters to me and that i did through all these 4 years is here in this city, unlike my hometown.\n\nYesterday i call my mother to check  on her as always, and immediately starts asking when i'm coming back and says that when i do i need to stay by her side to support her and that she needs a man by her side (i saw this coming eventually and whenever the topic started in the past i always implied that i'm not coming back to stay).

Something I have been craving forever. I was sitting there, smelling the lo mein noodles just remembering what they tasted like. And I got pissed. Because not only was I about to cook dinner and he spoiled it, but hes sitting there eating food in front of me that I miss so badly. I had to run and cry. He threw it away but It doesnt make up for the fact that I have to sit there and smell it in the house all night. We arent fighting about it, but I feel like an asshole because he threw it away. (I didnt ASK him to throw it out) so reddit, AITA?\n        ",

Currently, he uses it a lot more than I do since he has a job. There are often times when I go a week or more without using the car, while he uses it practically everyday. The problem is, even if it was spotless, if it's just him using it for more than a few days, it becomes a complete shithole. When it was the opposite - I used it everyday and he hardly did - I would keep it clean. I've repeatedly asked him to clean up after himself, but he doesn't.\n\nThe other day, I had plans with friends that I'd made a few weeks in advance. I'd checked with to make sure he didn't need the car then, so he knew when it was. I already hadn't used it in a couple weeks then, and it had been clean the last time I did.\n\nI asked and reminded him countless times to clean out the car, and told him every time that if I did it, everything would be thrown away. Every single time, he said he'd do it, but he didn't. Even though he had weeks and plenty of reminders and warnings, the car never got cleaned. [Edit: I also told my parents about how dirty the car was and what I would do if he didn't clean it.]\n\nSo on the day of my plans, an hour before I'd need to leave, I went in with a handful of trash bags and tossed everything. All the garbage, food, all the dirty clothes, his pellet gun ammo, his entire backpack, his homework and projects, his bluetooth speaker, I threw it all away.\n\nI'm not completely heartless, so I didn't actually completely follow through; his backpack, school stuff, speaker, and ammo were put in a separate trash bag that was put down next to the bin in the garage. The rest of it was mixed together in a couple other bags (it was all mixed on the floor anyway) along with the rubber gloves I wore to do the deed.\n\nI went and had a blast with my friends, and a few hours in, I checked my phone for the first time. He had been blowing it up for the first 2 1/2 or so hours after I left. I had hundreds of texts, dozens of missed calls, and 20-some voicemails, most of which were him berating me. He was pissed. I left him suffer until I dropped my friends off (5 or so hours in total) before telling him where his stuff was. I would've told him when I first checked my phone, if he hadn't called me every name in the book. [Edit: I don't know how he knew I had thrown his stuff away, and I can't get an answer from him]\n\nHe says I'm the AH, my parents say I'm the AH, but my friends and sister say I'm not. So, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My brother didn't clean out the car like he said he would, so I threw everything away like I said I would(mostly - important things were separated from the actual garbage without him knowing). He cussed me out like a sailor on crack, so I let him suffer for a few hours. AITA?\n\nEdit: the first covid-19 case within a hundred miles of me was on March 8th.

My step-father is a great man and the only father I\u2019ve ever known (I am the product of a drunken one night stand and I don\u2019t know/never met my bio dad). I call my step-dad by his first name. He\u2019s mentioned way back when he and my mom first got together that he\u2019d love for me to call him dad and stuff one day. I just was never comfortable with the word \u201cdad\u201d because I had never used it.

But I'd assume most people didn't baby their laptops like mine.

My superior eventually caught on to what I was doing and wasn't too pleased... but no client ever noticed and they all loved my food!\n\n**EDIT**: None of them had any severe allergies. They refused the food because they disliked the flavor or texture of mushrooms, or onions, or whatever. I thought they were being little bitches about it and that it was all between their ears, basically. The whole ignorance is bliss sort of thing. And as it turns out, it was just them being picky eaters. I dealt with their aversion to certain ingredients the same exact way I dealt with my kids' aversion to the same ingredients and it worked like a charm.\n        ",

He skipped on court-ordered child support for me and my brothes (22m, 20m) for years and we pretty much had no contact from 2014-2019. In 2018, after we reached a settlement in Court, he started to pay CS again and gave us some land he had to cover the amount he didn't pay in the last four years (the land transfer was my mother's idea)\n\nLast year he reached out to my brothers and I and we started a relationship with him (my mother suggest that we talk to him to try and get him to pay more than what was decided on the settlement), however things went sour betwen him and my brothers (as he paid child support after the deadline and \"fired\" my brother that was - remotely - interning for him because his company wasn't doing well and he couldn't afford the extra costs), however I decided that I had no problem with him and kept the relationship going. Menwhile my relationship with my mother has been going from bad the worst, we fight constantly and she is very abusive towards me.\n\nWell, last week my father told me that he is coming to my city (he lives 1250 miles away and comes for a week every month) invited me to dine alone with him on Tuesday (yesterday) and with my boyfriend (23m) and I today (Wednesday), which I agreed to. I should add that my boyfriend is going a three-week trip on Saturday, so we did plan to see each other on today's dinner and tomorrow, also my boyfriend doesn't want to see my mother for some time due to the way she has been treating me.\n\nToday I received a text from my mother in the family whatsapp group saying that we're all going out to have dinner today to celebrate \"our families achievements\" (due to my brothers recently getting paid internships), I then said that I couldn't today or tomorrow due to previous plans, but that I could every day from Friday and asked if we could reschedule.\n\nShe then asked what I was doing and I told her that I'd be staying over at my boyfriends (which is true and I will) and couldn't reschedule because I want to spend time with him before he travels (also true). No one said anything else, but then my brother texted me angry saying that he knows I'm going out with our father and not with my bf because our father invited him (my brother) to come as well. He then told my whole family what I was going to do and they are all furious with me that I am choosing my father over them and saying how I'm ungrateful and that he is an awful person that this X Y and Z to us and how could I and etc. However they just sprung this dinner on me and I don't want to cancel on my dad NAD ESPECIALLY I don't want to miss seeing my bf.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for deciding to keep my plans instead of cancelling on my father and going out with them?\n        ",

I am leaning towards just his name but since we are not married I am  having a hard time completely giving myself over to this. I asked his opinion on maybe hyphenating the baby\u2019s last name on the birth certificate but for everything else just using his last name. He told me \u201cno, it\u2019s only my last name\u201d. When I asked why he felt that way or what reasons he could come up with, I was told it was \u201clame\u201d and \u201cdumb\u201d and that I would ruin our child\u2019s life by doing this.

(I had PPD and also found out my bf at the time was cheating, she knew this, meanwhile her sister stole her favorite shirt or something). \nAnyways, when my daughter was about 3 she reached out and apologized and we became friends again.

I sent her a text saying I couldn\u2019t go because it was my birthday and I had plans, she replied with something kind of passive aggressive and I just didn\u2019t reply because I was slightly annoyed but also busy at the time. A week later I texted her about something unrelated and she replied with a long text saying that because I ignored her (again a week), that she doesn\u2019t want to be my friend and that her boyfriends party was planned before my plans so I should have at least made an appearance because she thought we were friends and that\u2019s what friends do and that she didn\u2019t even remember it was my birthday when she planned it on that day so I shouldn\u2019t have left her on read for a whole week over something so silly (according to her). \nCut to now, I haven\u2019t talked to her since that day and she just got a job as a teaching assistant at my daughters school.

The doctors said it isn\u2019t necessarily a risk on its own, and travelling wouldn\u2019t increase any risk - but if anything was to go wrong, it could be fairly catastrophic (lots of bleeding etc) so they banned her from flying. \n\nAs the holiday was booked with the rest of the family I had to decide whether I would go with them and leave my wife behind (with her family for company, who it has to be said would definitely spoil her - though they live an hour and a half\u2019s drive away). \n\nMy wife and I discussed it and decided that since there was no real risk to her or the baby\u2019s health, and since she had a strong support network at home (and it was only a short flight back if anything did go wrong) then I could go, but it would be nice if I stayed. \n\nThe holiday has come and gone without any issue, but I still can\u2019t square in my mind whether I was an asshole to go. \n\nFor context:\n\n- We could have got a full refund on both of our flights and my family would have covered the cost of our accommodation (wife got a refund, we all covered her accommodation). \n\n- My wife is currently suffering from pelvic girdle pain which means she\u2019s quite limited in terms of what she can do at home and out and about (though she did spend 5 hours shopping for baby gear with her mum, and I think had a nice time doing it). \n\n- We discussed doing nice things around our home city instead of the trip, but I pointed out this is a false dichotomy and we can still have a nice weekend in the city as well as the holiday. \n\nSo. AITA?\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: WIBTA for complaining about a Costco cashier's rude behavior? | I (26F) was at Costco with my mom (59F) today. Even though it was Christmas Eve, it was about as busy as it usually is. It was around 2PM so this was far before the store was close to closing.\n\nMy mom and I got into the checkout line, and the cashier just mumbles a greeting. She seems stressed, which is fine and understandable, so my mom and I didn't chat with her too much. When she gave my mom the total, my mom pulled her wallet out and was having a difficult time grabbing her card (she has some pretty bad carpal tunnel). During these five seconds of fumbling, the cashier was giving my mom a stare that could kill. Her breathing intensified and her nostrils flared with every breath. I stared at her and waited for her to look at me, but she never looked over at me.\n\nAt first I sort of thought saying anything to customer service would be over the top, as I have no idea what is happening in her life right now and she could just be having a bad day. But we went to some other stores, and the employees were so personable and kind despite the holiday and the extra crowds. I guess I'm just upset because this woman was being so rude to my mom, who is a sweet sweet lady. But I'm wondering if I'm overreacting because she wasn't outwardly rude to my mom, she was more of a subtle rude.\n\nWIBTA to call Costco customer service and report her behavior, which would risk getting her fired? Would it be weird if I told them not to fire her, but just make them aware of the behavior so they can talk to her about it? Am I turning into a Karen?\n\nI appreciate the advice!\n\nEdit: Okay, yes, I am overreacting to something small. This is what I expected, as it is a high stress time of year, it's a holiday, and anything could be going on in her life. If someone treated me this way, I would have shrugged it off, but I guess I got defensive because it involved my mom. I suppose I was appalled because I have worked high stress jobs with customers, and couldn't imagine being rude to a client, even when I have had external issues going on or if it has been hours after I was supposed to leave. But we all handle stress differently, and some of us conceal it better than others. Thanks!\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA? Had a bad date where she walked out on me | Hi Reddit,\n\nI (38m) recently had a horrible date with a girl (37f). The backstory is, we actually went on a date from a dating site 4 years ago. I drove an hour to meet at a place closer to her. It didn't go well. The reason cited at the time was distance as I was an hours' drive away and she only wanted something \"5 minutes away or so\". She also seemed to hint I wasn't at her \"level\" of success, though we both wanted something long term. For background, she's got a PhD and has a successful career. I had a masters, but was still relatively early in starting up my career.\n\nFast forward to present day, and lo and behold, we match again on a different app. Only this time, I've moved for a new (significantly better) job and am about 5 minutes from her neighborhood she's stayed in for the past 4 years. The first red flag was she had NO recollection that we had gone out before. How many different people have you dated if you don't remember ever meeting up with me? Anyway, we chat on the app and find she's super stressed and burned out all the time at work. Her dating life hasn't been going well as she's still on these apps 4 years later. In the same neighborhood.\n\nI offer to meet up with her again. I'll also admit she's very pretty. We meet at a bar and go over what's been going on. She still doesn't remember me, but talks about her most recent ex from a couple months ago. The guy didn't want anything long term, requested an \"open relationship\" from the beginning when they started dating, lived very far away, was emotionally unavailable (her words), her friends hated him, and they dated like this for 12 months. In my mind I'm thinking this just sounds like an extended booty call, but keep silent. She then mentions she has high expectations for a significant other, and won't compromise, which is her choice of course.\n\nThis all sounded hypocritical given everything I'd learned about her and how our original first date 4 years ago went. When we originally met back then, I was \"too far\" away, and not at the proper success level. Now I find she's okay with doing an open relationship with someone who lives far away and doesn't want anything long term? On top of that, she mentions she wants to be married and have kids eventually. I mention that might be hard to find if you're not willing to compromise, and those guys who might meet her checklist criteria could be douchey as well (see her ex), and I could see her getting divorced if that happens. I didn't say this in a mean or lecturing sort of tone. She then flips and says she's gonna leave now, and immediately walks out. I sat there for a moment, finished my drink, picked up the tab, and left. I think about it and laugh a bit now given the absurdity of the entire situation. Was I an asshole here? Or did I just dodge another bullet for the second time?\n        ",

My car is to sit on the right hand of the front, and on trash days I park in the back of the garage to allow the trash cans to go outside. \n\nNow this hasn\u2019t been a problem. The girl I park next to doesn\u2019t like to share space in the front (she doesn\u2019t leave much room for me to get out of the drivers side) but I don\u2019t move my car much except weekends so I park in the back indefinitely since that\u2019s technically an extension of my spot. \n\nWhen I moved in I noticed an electric scooter charging in the back by my car.

I just find it hard to be open, warm and outgoing to anyone except for family and close friends because I've been hurt a lot.\n\nOn Friday, I had a student approach me about getting a recommendation for precalculus honors, the next level of math beyond my class. She did okay but not great the first semester. A B is anywhere from 75 to 87 percent, and she got an 82 so I guess that puts her in the middle of the range. That already bumps her down to \u201crecommends\u201d from \u2018\u201crecommends strongly\u201d in my book as my class is not difficult at all compared to the Algebra 2 Honors class my colleague teaches. \n\nI ultimately gave her a \u201crecommends with major reservations\u201d because of her so-so performance and also because she doesn\u2019t participate in class. I have a hard time getting anyone to participate honestly, except for the really outgoing students, and am not sure why. But I only give strong-A students and active participants recommends strongly. I said to her verbatim, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t participating in class, how are you making the classroom environment better?\u201d She said something about having social anxiety and not being confident in her calculations all the time, to which I replied, \"If you aren't confident in your math skills why do you want to take another hard math class?\"\n\nShe looked a bit downcast but didn\u2019t really say anything else after I filled out the paper. \n\nOn the same day I filled out her form, I also gave a math test on the day before vacation (Friday) and during the exam, she came up to ask me a question.

She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for excluding my former best friend from my bachelorette party? | So I (25F) am getting married this October. Choosing my wedding party was tough because I had 3 really close friends growing up. One of them (Caty), was basically my best friend all throughout school. Caty, me, and our friend Lauren did everything together in high school. Later on, we became really close with Lauren's friend Anna as well. Caty and I were still close in college, but since then we've sort of drifted apart since we both went to grad school in different states. I see Lauren and Anna more frequently because they live close to me, but I don\u2019t see Caty outside of planned get togethers. As a result, when I got engaged last fall, I asked Lauren and Anna to be in the wedding (Lauren\u2019s the MOH), but I didn't ask Caty.\n\nI didn't really think anything of it, but a couple months later, Lauren asked me if I'd talked to Caty. I said I hadn't and Lauren (gently) said that I should at least reach out to Caty since no one really understood why I\u2019d excluded her from the bridal party. So I called Caty, we talked and she seemed really understanding about the wedding party. I also told Caty that she was really the only non-bridal party friend I wanted at the bachelorette party, but explained that I was afraid of drama with my cousin if I opened it up beyond the bridal party (my cousin\u2019s a drama queen). It was easier to just say \u201cbridal party only.\u201d Caty said that if I wanted her to be there, she would love to come and I told her I hadn\u2019t decided yet but I\u2019d tell her when I did.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I realized that I didn't want Caty to feel more left out because she would be the only one in the bachelorette party who wasn\u2019t in the wedding. So I told Lauren to go ahead planning the bachelorette party and to keep it wedding-party only. The thing is...I never actually told Caty I decided not to invite her.\n\nSo yesterday was my bridal shower and Caty, Anna and Lauren were all there. Later that night, we were hanging out at Lauren's house and Anna started talking about the bachelorette party. I guess she didn't know that Caty wasn't invited and assumed Caty was invited and going. Lauren was looking at me kind of panicked, but I didn't want to call attention to it and make it more awkward, so Anna kept talking about how much fun the bachelorette party was going to be. Caty didn't say anything, but eventually, she excused herself and when she came back, her eyes were really red. Still, she didn\u2019t bring it up when she drove me home later so I figured she was probably fine.\n\nSo: AITA for not inviting her to the bachelorette party, and not telling her that she wasn't invited? I figured if she was there it would just be extra awkward because she'd be the only one not in the bridal party. But Caty didn't do anything wrong and I feel bad that she had to find out because Anna brought it up.\n\nEdit: wow, ok, I get it. ITA. I can be pretty oblivious and I honestly didn\u2019t think we were close anymore so I didn\u2019t think she would care (also, with my cousin - I was at her bachelorette party so I wanted to be able to draw a clean line for why I wasn't opening up the bachelorette party, but other than that, i have no defense. I just hate confrontation). Clearly, though, I hurt her a lot more deeply than I thought. I\u2019m going to call Caty tonight and apologize. I\u2019d do it face to face, but I live in Virginia and she lives on the West Coast, so it\u2019ll have to be by phone.\n        ",

She wants to take them on a European vacation to celebrate her new marriage to her new husband, but I won't allow it. She has threatened to take me to court over it, and if she does, I'll fight her tooth and nail. Here's why:\n\n1. The principle reason: my kids have called her new husband \"dad\" before they even got engaged. She refused to discourage it and let them get attached to him to the point where they seem to like him more than they like me. Which leads to my next reason.\n2. Her new husband makes much more than I do and can spoil the kids more. This trip will probably be entirely on his dime, making him out to be the better \"dad\" than me.\n3. This trip will conflict with my parenting time. I only get my kids one day a week, and this would take that day away from me and would ruin our schedule. My ex offered to give me a different day, but I only have time that one day per week to do a fun day. She and her new husband already get so much time with them that I think it's ridiculous to both ask for more time and to take them to do something I can never afford for them.\n\nAm I an asshole for putting my foot down and refusing to let her take them?\n\nEdit: I cannot make the day up because I already see my kids during my one day off per week and during al my vacation days. I don't get any other time off, so this is one less day I get to see them no matter which way you cut it. And the kids do not know about the trip.\n\nEdit 2: for those of you saying to just schedule a day off, you are missing that I already spend ALL my days off and vacation days with my kids. There is no additional time off to schedule that I wouldn't be spending with my kids. If she takes them during one of my days off, there is no other time for me to make that up, because all my days off and vacation days are already being spent with my kids.\n        ",

I do not want legal advice (got that) just a judgment on the situation.\n\n**EDIT:**  Harsh - I feel like I need to explain some things.  I admit it was my mistake that I leveled the yard in the first place BUT hear me out.  I did not know I was doing anything wrong when I had the drainage trench dug b/c I thought if the water was directed to his yard (and not toward his house which it IS NOT).  I did do it when he was gone on purpose b/c I thought he would be mad (but I also thought there was nothing he could do about it - like putting up a fence or something when the person is gone) so I wanted to avoid drama.  Third - his yard is totally usable.  In a heavy rain it will back up for maybe 30 minutes before is all drains out.  He has turf and drainage system - I thought it would just drain out with the rest (I admit I didn't think about it being too much water or the added wear and tear so i am wrong there).  I also think my SIL has a point - that there is a process he can go through to address this, but I guess I will try to work something out with him and try to avoid court.\n\nMy neighborhood was built with the backyards graded so rainwater runs away from the house straight out the back of the yard.  For simplicity, we will say the backyards are 20 yards long.  When I bought my house, I had them level the yard (my kids are into sports so it made sense).  My neighbor (more on him below) told me at the time not to do it.  Turns out he was right - bad idea - when it rains I have standing water in the middle portion of my backyard.\n\nNeighbor is about 10 years older than me and has lived in his house longer (was there when I moved in).  He has an addition on the back of his house that takes up 5 yards and a floating deck (meaning not attached to his house) that takes up the last 5 yards of his backyard.  The middle 10 yards are artificial turf with a drainage system underneath (again all of this was in place when I moved in to my house).\n\nProblem:  I have been at home due to current situation and its been rainy and I hate my yard being unusable.  I had a landscaper come out who quoted me between $5-7K to fix my backyard (regrade, add a drywell and put a french drain around the house).  I did not want to spend the $ so I decided to do it myself.  I got some guys from Home Depot and simply had them dig a drainage trench so the middle 10 yards of my yard drain under the fence onto my neighbors turf.  My neighbor is an essential worker type so he was gone when I did this (somewhat purposefully b/c he can be kinda smug about home improvement stuff  and did not want his advice).  When he realized what I did he flipped his shit and told me to that I wasn't \"allowed\" to do that and to fix it.  I said \"make me\" (not the best, I agree).\n\nSo I got a letter from his attorney saying fix it or he will sue (basically the turf drainage system is not built for that much water and it will cause it to back up and he will have to replace it sooner).  I showed the letter to my SIL who is a lawyer.  She said legally he is 100% correct BUT then she said with the courts closed right now for these types of cases and the backlog that will be created it could take years before we are actually in front of a judge and who knows what will happen in that time.  She also said that in the end the judge might not make me fix it b/c his yard isn't unusable  but i would have to pay him damages (though probably not as much as it would cost now to fix everything).  Worst case scenario, I would have to pay to fix it (which I would have to pay anyway if I just did it now).  She said that there is a process to address these types of issues (the courts) and I should just let it play it out.  AITA?\n        ",

There are only a handful of other women who teach here and the majority of us are in our 50s-60s. The other younger two are both obese. So for the most part, inappropriate attention from students really isn't an issue- I know that sounds weird but it's something you have to look out for. You have to watch how you interact with students, how you dress, etc. \n\nThis past fall, for the first time in five years, a new female teacher joined us. I'll call her J. J is 27, fresh out of college and very beautiful. However, she dresses very inappropriately for work: short dresses (above the knee), tight pants/skirts, low cut shirts, etc. It's not shockingly provocative, but it's obviously inappropriate for work. At first, some of the cattier women at work immediately jumped on her and constantly began making rude remarks towards her. I figured they were just jealous, so I took it upon myself to befriend her. I also figured someone would eventually speak to her about her outfits, so I kept my mouth shut. However, a the semester went on, her outfits got increasingly more provocative, so much that we all noticed.  And of course with this came more snarky comments from coworkers and students beginning to talk. \n\nI ended privately speaking with my boss, M, about the way J dresses. M is not a subtle guy and does not usually take people's feelings into consideration so when I spoke with him I made sure to explain that this was something that should be handled privately and delicately. He seemed like he understood but the next day during lunch when we were all on the same lunch break, M proceeded to tell J in front of everyone how inappropriate she was dressing and that it reflected poorly on our school. J left in tears. When it came out (and I don't how it did, but it did) that I was the one that reported her, all the female teachers accused me of slut shaming J because I was jealous of her. I found this sort of funny given how they had been treating her. The male teachers seem to be on my side, however. It's completely split between guys and girls.\n\nI don't whether or not this was the right way to have handled this- it was the most professional way I could think of. It was not my intention to embarrass J but I did feel that her dressing the way she has wasn't appropriate for school- especially being around teenage boys all day. That being said, I ended up humiliating her in front of all of her coworkers. But I had the schools' intentions in mind so I don't feel that I owe anyone an apology. AITA? I'm lost on who's in the right.\n        ",

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \n\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \n\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \n\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

He lives in a house with 3 other people, owned by one girl. It's a super nice house, and they're all good friends. At first I was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but I met them early and they seemed cool.\n\nUntil this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which I heard are always amazing. I was invited, and I wanted to bring my emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with me. I have really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so I thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. I even put her ESA harness on her. But when we got to the door, my boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would I give notice that I am bringing my support animal with me?\n\nSo I asked her what if I was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if I was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for me, and that if I was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for me anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. I kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of my dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property. This kept going on for like 15 minutes and she got more and more annoyed, saying she's seen me a hundred times out without the dog, but it's a party which is duh, where I'm more likely to have anxiety so of course I wanted her there.\n\nAfter going back and forth she was basically like, \"look, the dog isn't coming into my house. That's final. You can put her in the backyard but that's it.\"\n\nWhile in the backyard, Sadie dug up some stuff because she's used to always being with me and I guess broke or chewed a chair. I'm fine with paying for those things if me and my bf stay together, but I kinda don't want to because if she'd just let my dog stay with me it wouldn't have even happened and because my bf didn't really take my side against his housemate and said it would be best if I don't bring Sadie over there again in the future as his housemate is really pissed.\n\nAITA for getting into it with her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For the people focused on me not wanting to pay, I said I didn't want to, not that I won't, but as I said in the comments:  The chewing in the backyard, I didn't even see, so I'm not even sure if it happened or if it was her and asked for pictures but still haven't seen any, and the flowers my bf sent me a picture, doesn't look like she dug them up, but instead was walking on them since they were right next to the backdoor and she wanted to get to me. I still get that I should have to pay if she messed up the flowers, that's not the point.\n\nALSO: My argument wasn't that she's legally allowed to be in the house, just that it's dickish to refuse because it's a support animal. It was more than my dog is an esa so does have some legal rights and isn't \"just a pet\". Even a service animal can't go into a private house, duh, everyone knows that. That's why I said she totally missed my point. But whoever that person is that says a service animal CAN'T is an asshole which is why I think she is the asshole.\n        ",

Our final essay for the semester was prompted with \u201cHow does Fitzgerald use color as a motif in the Great Gatsby?\u201d \n\nI was falling behind in my work this semester and I seriously needed to write a good essay. At this point, I do NOT want to do summer school. Again. So I start writing my essay and I\u2019m searching for examples of color being used as a motif - and I barely find anything. In fact, I find way MORE examples of color being used to describe literal colors and nothing else. So I decide to write my essay on how Fitzgerald Does Not Use Color as a Motif in The Great Gatsby. Now, for many years in my English classes, I usually write my argumentative essays from the point of view opposite of mine, to make it more fun and to challenge myself. So there I am, and I write a pretty damn good essay, if you ask me. My arguments were pretty convincing. I shared it with my friends and asked what they all thought, all of them having taken the class before, and I thought I was good to go. The only reason I should lose points now is grammar mistakes or weak commentary or something.\n\nTwo weeks later, I get the grades back, and this is the notification I get on my phone:\n\nTicklepoot has an updated grade in AP Lang: 63.52%\n\nTicklepoot got a 0% on Final Essay - Comprehension of Concept\n\nTicklepoot got a 0% on Final Essay - Command of language.\n\n\nThat\u2019s right - I got the same grade as someone who didn\u2019t write an essay at all. The only feedback on my paper, when it was returned to me, was \u201cFitzgerald does use color as a motif. Paper doesn\u2019t address prompt.\u201d Now, if you ask me, my paper absolutely addressed the fucking prompt, Ms. Teacher. If you ask someone how they do something, they can say that they don\u2019t.

I wasn\u2019t asking if my thesis was wrong. That\u2019s not what matters, and frankly, I knew that already. In my school, your thesis doesn\u2019t have to be correct for your paper to be graded, it never has. I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019m wrong for taking the opposite side. I knew even back then that my thesis was probably wrong. My thought process was that my arguments were good and my evidence was unique, so that would be the big point-getter in my essay.

We have seen him maybe twice on his own since they got together (the two Christmases probably, lol). He moved into her house immediately and has lived there ever since. He has lost all of his friends by ditching them to spend time with her... they are literally joined at the hip. Now we all like the girlfriend, but we miss our brother/ son and spending time with him. I used to be so close to him, but now we barely speak. \n\nNow he's announced that they are spending Christmas together, and without asking, has announced that she will be joining us Christmas morning, during present opening time with my siblings, me and my mum. \n\nI'm really upset by this. I honestly cherish that family time so much, particularly as I never see my brother on his own anymore. A single hour or two on Christmas morning is surely not too long to spend apart from eachother? \nMy mum doesn't care, she welcomes the girlfriend to join us, but I just feel like Christmas morning is ruined for me now. \n\nAITA because I don't want her to come?\n\n\nEdit to add: For those who think I'm alone and haven't found my own independence yet - I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years, living together for 2!

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for playing videogames with headphones while looking after a baby? | So I've been having arguments with my partner lately about looking after our baby (8 mo). She's recently returned to work on a part-time basis, but I have the option of working from home so have decided to do it to save on childminding costs. Most of the time I can work with the little one next to me and take care of her if she's grumpy or wants attention, the rest of the time she sleeps upstairs in her crib with a video baby monitor on.\n\nNow, sometimes I finish my work and fire up Fortnite for a few rounds to relax. Anyone who's played Fortnite will know that the game's audio is very important to playing well, so I have a nice pair of over-ear headphones to hear what other players are doing. The other day my partner came home to find me playing Fortnite with these headphones on while our baby slept upstairs.\n\nEdit: probably should add that the specific circumstances were her arriving home, calling my name and me being unable to hear her because of the headphones. I only knew she was there when she tapped me on the shoulder and I turned around to find her absolutely furious with me. /edit\n\nShe hit the roof, saying that I need to pay attention at all times to what's going on in the house, and that the headphones would mean I could ignore stuff that's happening. I pointed out that I keep the video baby monitor next to the PC and can always see what she's doing while playing. She said I wasn't taking being a father seriously if I play videogames while I'm supposed to be childminding.\n\nIATA in this situation? I feel like there's no way I'd miss that something was up with the baby and being able to see her is maybe even better than hearing her? Like, what I am going to miss here?\n\nUPDATE\n\nOkay, it seems fairly conclusive that I am the asshole in this scenario. I hadn't realized the potential audio problems I could miss while wearing headphones that I wouldn't get through a video feed and won't be using them anymore while I'm alone in the house with our baby. A poster suggested getting a Switch and quietly using that in her room while she sleeps, so I'm going to do that.\n\nBut chatting about this with my partner (who has now seen this thread and says you are all absolutely right) has been a real eye-opener. She'd said a few weeks back she was looking forward to getting back to her career, but apparently has actually been incredibly unhappy while back at work and constantly worrying about what she's missing at home. \n\nOn top of that, she can't help but feel jealous of me for spending so much time with our baby, and that as my job means I can be home indefinitely (and the nature of my job gives me a lot of time to devote to the baby) and as she will soon go back to very long full-time hours (she's a lawyer), she feels like she's going to miss out on being a Mom. \n\nAll that and coming home to find me semi-ignoring the baby to play videogames was the straw that broke the camel's back. She wants what I've got, and she was furious I wasn't appreciating it. So basically, right now, she needs to know she can trust me implicitly to pay full attention with ALL of my senses.

However he gave his wife a life interest which means she can stay in the house as long as she wants to so i share the house with her.\n\nBit of backstory, everyone HATES his wife because she treated my family like shit for over 20 years. A few weeks ago my mother came by the house because she wanted to take one of his TVs to her house and the widow threw a tantrum, openly disrespecting my mother and threatening to call the police if she didn't leave. My mother told her she didn't want any trouble she just wanted the TV which was rightfully hers and that would be it. A lawyer came and settled it and my mother took the TV and that was that.\n\nYesterday she sent my mother a cease and desist letter at her workplace as well as a restraining order preventing my mother from coming near the house. My mom used to be the only person in the family who actually liked her so this caused a rift. Now the wife is threatening me with a lawyer because i don't pay bills (I'm still a student so i don't work yet).My close family think she's doing all this because she wants the house for herself. So i decided to end all this and sell the house and all the stuff in it.  Now her family who have nothing to do with the issue are attacking me saying she'll have no place to live and i'm a horrible person but i've had enough of this conflict. Am i the asshole?\n\nEdit: After reading all the comments i decided to call a counselor to hold a family meeting. Hopefully something good turns up out of this and the conflict will end. I'd have for this to turn into a disgusting legal battle.\n\nEdit: To all of you telling me to get a job and i'm living rent free, there's a law where i live that protects students under a certain age from being sued for living rent free under a relative. Once i pass that age i have to pay property taxes and bills.\n\nEdit: I realise i've been a massive dick in this situation. I'll try apologizing to her for even suggesting it as a start and hopefully get my mom to do the same and maybe this can be the beginning of peace.\n        ",

End of conversation. Didn't hear another word about it, so I thought we were good. That is, until yesterday. I was in the passenger seat, his two kids in the back, he was driving. Out of nowhere, he just stops at a light and refuses to move until my seatbelt is on. Like, straight up, \"put your seatbelt on now, or i'm not moving. I'm serious, now!\" So, of course I put it on. I refused to talk to him the rest of the ride home, because I am super against fighting in front of his kids. Period. When we got home, it was a straight up fight. I wasn't upset that he asked me to put on my seatbelt, I was upset that he demanded I do so, in what I consider a controlling and demeaning manner. In front of his kids (4 & 6). If he had sat me down to discuss why it was so important to him, I would have listened. He kinda apologized, but in one of those \"sorry I said that, but heres my defense for saying it\" kind of ways, that you know isn't actually an apology. And now he's super pissed at me. Won't talk to me and slept on the couch last night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, so really, AITA for not putting on my seatbelt the first time he asked? Or is it justified the way he handled it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Fair, ITA for not wearing my seatbelt.

I'll describe the event that was the catalyst to our break up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was during exam period for university. 3 days before my first exam, we went on a casual date to the local mall. I thought it would be good to meet up and release some of our stress. We had Chinese noodles for lunch. While eating, we got talking. I was telling her about a YouTube video I watched the other day. It was an informative speech made by a psychologist about cheating. The psychologist explained most cheaters don't go out of their way to cheat. And when it happens, most people are surprised they're doing it themselves. It's almost unexpected. She also explained how cheating has existed for a very long time where we probably won't be able to get rid of it as a social condition. I felt I learned a different perspective of cheating and thought to share this to my gf at the time. I didn't notice anything wrong straight away. The meal continued as normal and we talked about different things as well. When we finished the meal, we paid and proceeded to browse the shops. She got progressively worse and when I asked her what was wrong it was like she was having an anxiety attack. She wouldn't talk to me for the remainder of the date and we walked out of the mall back to the car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne the way back and in the car, I occasionally tried to start up a conversation but she felt silent. I was growing more flustered and had no idea what was going on. She began by questioning me and asking me questions about cheating. I answered and was thinking through the topic as well. It's safe to say I have never thought about some of the questions she asked me in a proper and serious manner. Especially considering how flustered I became, the environment where we had this talk wasn't calm in the least. Our discussion kept on going around in a circle and it felt like she wasn't listening to me at all and only feeding into her own fear. She kept on brushing off everything I said and wasn't taking it in at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe finally asked me \"Would you ever cheat on me?\" Part of me knew obviously to say \"No.\" Even if I agreed or disagreed, I understand feelings are still important. The other half wanted to stay true to me and my way of thinking. I was thinking about what the lady said in the video and how things can just happen. I also didn't want to say a promise I couldn't keep. In the end I chose to say something along the lines of not answering with a firm no. Something like \"I cannot promise you that\". She got very sad and upset. That was the last time we ever talked in person. I sent a very long apology text later that night after thinking it through. I knew I had hurt her. However, I wanted to explain my side and how I couldn't betray myself and my way of thinking. Unfortunately she couldn't understand my perspective. She explained how she couldn't forgive me for saying something like that.\n        ",

To answer some of the common questions, 1. 10k is a lot of money for me (20% of my salary), but I inherited my grandparents house so money I\u2019d spend on rent is put towards savings.  2. My gf isn\u2019t much of a pet person and never had one before.  3. I chose not to get insurance because it\u2019s about $120/month and my last dog had no health problems til he was a senior and treatment would\u2019ve just given him an extra couple of miserable months.  I\u2019d rather save in case I need it rather than pay for insurance monthly.  4. If it came down to it I would of course choose summer over my gf.

I left the pricing on at $0.50 a game, and my buddies are all up in arms about it. They think they should play for free since its here in my house and not in an arcade. I think its a $1900 machine that WILL need specialized maintenance down the road, and that ain't cheap. They don't seem to understand, and I don't know how to explain it any better. AITA here?\n\nEDIT 1: No it isnt like a tv, pool, game system or board game. It has a lot of moving parts that actively bang against eachother, a computer inside, lighting, high quality speakers, etc. That alone makes it different from any other form of entertainment at my house, all of which i gladly provide for free. We split money for beer/pizza during our hangouts anyway, i feel like this is no different. And yes, i also pay the 0.50 as well, i keep a change jar.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm seeing a lot of comparisons to cars, toilets, playstations and the like, but that's not what I am asking. \"Pinball Machine\" seems to sit in a strange category. Its not a standard thing everyone has and pays for, and its not something that is easily maintained by just any technition like a plumber or an oil-change guy. Would I charge my friends to use any of that other stuff? Of course not. But are they valid comparisons? I am not so sure.\n\nFINAL EDIT: So my buddies and I have been chatting it out online, and we decided as a group I don't have to chip in for pizza anymore, and they get to play pinball as much as they want. What a nice compromise! Reddit is sure I am the asshole, which is fine, but we worked it out as friends. Thanks for your input, guys!\n        ",

They work fridays and saturdays and rarely on  weekdays if there is a bigger event.\n\nThis season, a new girl, along with a couple other people, was hired. I'll call her Kate. Kate is 17 and she tries really hard. She's great with customers, always has a smile on her face and you'll rarely hear her complain. Genuinely just a nice, hard working kid.\n\nNow there are a lot of unspoken rules. Certain things have to be in certain places, even if there's no obvious reason for it, that sort of thing. We tell every new hiree about all of the rules and I make sure they know they can always ask if they need help with something.\n\nRecently, we started to notice certain things misplaced. We had a short meeting with all of the staff and I tried to get them to admit who it was. Not to punish them, but to explain why it had to be the other way. No one admited, which was fairly disappointing, but whatever. I explained the reason anyway, but we continued to find things in places they shouldn't be. I planned on setting up a meet with each of our staff individualy, hoping to resolve the issue.\n\nYesterday, Kate came to because she couldn't find a crate of quite expensive wine (think $150/bottle). I told her to look where the wine would usually be, but it wasn't there. That's when she said she put the crate elsewhere the day before, because she tought it would be more accesible there, but that it isn't there anymore. I asked her where she put it and basically she put it where we put empty wine/alcohol bottles at the end of shifts (she didn't know this, because only me and another guy take out the empty bottles as we stay longer than everyone else).\n\nNow me and my boss reviewed the footage and indeed, it showed her putting the wine there and 6 hours later, me and the other guy, collecting all the crates and taking them out (we stack them on a cart, so we didn't even notice the crate was heavy.\n\nNow he wants her to pay $1500 out of pocket for the 10 bottles. She asked me to talk to him and explain that she didn't mean to do it. I told her I was sorry, but we had told every single staff member where things have to be placed and she still did it her own way, therefore I couldn't do anything to help her. She broke down crying.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks I'm an asshole, says that I could've talked to my boss and maybe work something out, such as take a portion of the money out of her paychecks every month.

So naturally this is amazing for me, im finally giving something I never had.\n\nWell heres where the story turns sour. \n\nAs my wife and I were discussing this stuff, I suggested the idea to my son that he gives me part of his wage, I said give me 10 or 20, you'll be working and getting plenty of money from christmas and birthdays and such.\n\nOut of the blue, My wife has a go at me and suddenly it becomes an argument, and my son storms off into his room. Well shit im thinking whats gonna happen now.\n\nSo me and my wife were arguing, I calmed down the situation and said to my wife that Ill keep the money in his savings account, which already had about 500 quid in it, if he gets more in there, he could have enough for a car or lessons later on, which she said was an absolutely terrible idea and let him have his money\n\nWell I think like a quarter isnt a lot out of it and he still has plenty, And I've said im willing to still pay for things as long as he's smart with his money\n\nSo I don't think im being unreasonable, I think what Im doing is a really smart idea to save up really early on so that once he's 16, he can get a part time job, and save even more, And then he'll have a lot of money to get a car or something\n\nBut it seems from my wifes perspective she said that its his money and she should be able to do anything he wants with it\n\nSo AITA? What should I do to even out this situation?\n\nEdit; It seems I have mistakenly not told him that I would like to put the money into a savings, and teach him how money and banks work. Im going to take the opportunity for him to be alone, and teach him, I think all the suggestions I've had so far are actually really good and I'll definitely take it on board!\n\nEdit 2: I have my son down, and explained the situation.\nI told him about the magic of his savings account and when I said about his \u00a3638 waiting for him when he turns 18, His eyes LIT up. I explained that I would match whatever he puts in. He said \"So effectively Im getting paid double if I out all the money in\" which made me giggle haha. I will take him to the bank Tommorow, Show him the proof, and even get his first account set up, I said, You do not need to put all your money in their, save yourself some money per month to treat yourself, but I said I recommend he put at least 25% in and he said go figure 50% so you (Me) have to put in 20 quid a month. Im telling you, this kid is going places lol. Im happily going to match it, and I feel like a really proud dad now lol.

My SO has been mentioning over the past 2 - 3 months that we can spend it on \\[this\\] or \\[that\\]** without asking for my buy in to spend it.  I should confirm now that I don't want to blow my bonus on anything she is suggesting.  This annoys me and I've told her \"This is my bonus, I've worked hard for it and I don't want to just fritter it away\" but the point stands that is is **my** bonus.  I also like to have a back up fund \"just in case\"\\* but she is taking this as a personal affront.\n\nThe question I have is... AITA if I filter my bonus payment into my own personal account and leave my regular wage going into our joint account?  I have no usual qualms on how we manage our funds together but in this instance I just feel like she's spending my money before I've got it without recognizing that it is mine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: \"Just in case\" isn't in case I leave her but more if a car breaks down or a massive bill comes in that you can't account for.\n\n**EDIT**:  She does not get a bonus with her job but I wouldn't expect any of it any way (easy to say as it's a theoretical , i know I know..)\n\n**EDIT**:  To clarify what she would like to spend it on.  Her suggestions are holidays to places that I have no interest in, house aesthetics which (again) I believe we should be saving up for and I\u2019m not huge on, she also wants to buy an expensive piece of furniture to replace our existing one because it has small aesthetic damage to.   Nothing she wants to spend money on is urgent.  We don\u2019t have kids and live within our means.  The biggest challenge she has is she feels the need to spend every penny of what we earn and I\u2019m taking up with the fact she\u2019s already spending my bonus on activities we don\u2019t need and I don\u2019t really want.  If I say no, she then plays a face and makes me feel awful when, throughout our whole relationship and until the end of our lives, I will always make sure she lives to a good standard and spoil the shit out of her.  I have just drawn the line here.  The more I write of this the more I see it as a problem of my own causing.  Agreeing to a joint account and spoiling her may have put me here.  Idk but I accept my AH tag.  \n\nThank you for your responses - even the ones from people who clearly live perfect lives ;)\n        ",

Some background: I\u2019m a college sophomore living in an apartment style dorm with 2 singles and a double. \nCurrently, there\u2019s me (in a single), my roommate who we will call J (in a single), my roommate F and F\u2019s boyfriend B (in the double).\nLast semester we\u2019d had problems with B staying over most nights of the week, spending most of his time in our dorm, making messes and whatnot (even though he has his own single in a different dorm). We had multiple discussions with F and B about how his being there so often made the rest of us uncomfortable in our own place and we didn\u2019t think that was cool. We said it was fine for him to be there during the day sometimes and to spend a couple nights a week over (like the rest of our boyfriends do). Nothing changed.\nWe came back from winter break and B had completely moved in to the (newly empty) second bed in the double. There was no discussion about this. \nAgain, we told them we weren\u2019t comfortable with that, /especially/ since they didn\u2019t talk to us beforehand, and he\u2019s still here. (He still has a single that he pays for btw)\nSo I decided to go to the RD. Now F is crying saying she didn\u2019t think she\u2019s that bad of a roommate and she really doesn\u2019t want to get him involved, and she wishes we could solve this on our own.\n(And every time I give to meet with him, she\u2019s suddenly busy -_-)\nAITA?\n**(edit: I said RA but I meant RD)\nUpdate (3/3 7am): the RD looked over our class schedules to find times he knew we should all be free and gave us the options. F decided she\u2019d be able to meet this afternoon so we\u2019ll see what happens. Honestly I don\u2019t think there even needs to be a meeting, they just need to remove B, but I don\u2019t really know the proper procedures. If he\u2019s not been moved out by the end of this week, I will be going higher because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m coming back from spring break with him still living here. Thanks everyone for your responses!!\nFinal update: we met this afternoon with the RD and he told F that it is clearly and very much so against the rules for B to be living in our dorm. He gave them until Friday (because that\u2019s when spring break starts) to have him completely moved out. We also agreed that all boyfriends are allowed 2 weeknights to sleep over. Thanks for all of the responses! They were very helpful in how we worded things to our RD as well as F in the meeting!\n        ",

(no damage to any 3rd party property).\n\nBecause it was my first car, I could only afford 3rd party insurance... which meant I was not covered for accidental damage to my own car.\n\nAlthough damaged, it was still driveable and I managed to get back to base safely.\n\nThe front bumper had sprung back into shape, but the front edge of the bonnet/hood was dented beyond repair.\n\nI was aware that there may be underlying structural damage but the car drove fine and I wasn't really going that fast during the impact.\n\nA few weeks go by and I start to notice small puddles of oil where I park the car... about the size of a 10p/dime... clearly there's a leak most likely caused by damage during the crash.\n\nI took it to a garage and they told me I needed a lot of work doing to the engine, but structurally the car is safe.\n\nHowever, I couldn't afford the work so took the car away and parked it up on base.\n\nI did very little travelling home from base for a few months, and when I did I used public transport.\n\nMy parents were fully aware of the situation, and knew my car was parked on base, needing repairs.

But they told me that they had sold the car to \"the church\" for \u00a33000.\n\nI thought it was just on loan, so you can imagine my surprise.\n\nOK, I said... take the cost of the repairs away from the \u00a33000 and give me my money so I can use it as a deposit on a new car.\n\nThat's where things went sour... they were acting like I was trying to steal from the church, but I said no... you were paid \u00a33000 by the church for MY car... it's my money, but sure take away the repair costs.\n\nWe argued for a while, they said I was being unreasonable asking for the money, they argued that because I gave the car to them for their missionary friends it was technically a \"donation\" to the church and it's bad form to ask for a donation back. Also, they had already spent the money the church gave them for the car so didn't have it to give to me.\n\nAm I the asshole for trying to get my money back?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For those asking for more information regarding title/registration documents.  \n\nI'm in the UK.\n\nHere things are a little strange.\n\nThere is a difference between the owner and the registered keeper...\n\nNow obviously, an individual can be both owner and registered keeper.\n\nProof of ownership comes from the dealer, in the form of an invoice or receipt for payment.\n\nThe registration document of the vehicle does not prove ownership, just who the registered keeper is.\n\nIf you sell a car privately, you can change the registration document to show the new \"keeper\" details, but there is not usually a receipt handed over to prove ownership... normally just cash and a handshake.\n\nI signed the car's registration document over to my step-father as the registered keeper, as it was going to be at their address for the majority of the time.\n\nAlso, I did not want to receive any speeding tickets/fines that the missionaries might incur.\n\nI still legally owned the car because I had not given them a receipt for payment, because I didn't receive any payment.\n\n [http://www.dvla-contact-number.co.uk/the-differences-between-the-registered-keeper-and-owner-of-a-vehicle/](http://www.dvla-contact-number.co.uk/the-differences-between-the-registered-keeper-and-owner-of-a-vehicle/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI only agreed to the initial loan of the car for the church people to use, as a way of saying thank you for my parents repairing my car.\n\nThey knew I wanted the car back, but we agreed I would only get it back when I could pay them back for the repairs.\n\nFrom conversations I had overheard, I think they \"donated\" the car money back to the church (paid for something the church needed), so effectively the church bought the car off my parents as a tax write off, then got the money back straight away, so got the car for free... all a bit dodgy if you ask me, stinks of a scam to avoid tax or something.\n        ",

The only relevant issue here is that I'm a  germaphobe and my roommate is the exact opposite.\n\nI was cooking myself a meal on the stove for myself. My roommate came out and initiated conversation. I've lately been avoiding interacting with her because of her hygiene issue.  (I've told her politely that her odor makes me nauseated; but she can't help it because of her mental health.) During the conversation she was picking at her nose, teeth, and scratching herself inside her pants. I ignored the hygiene issues during the conversation because I couldn't leave my food half cooked and didn't want her getting angry with me for addressing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter my food was finished, I excused myself to go switch laundry. (This takes me less than two minutes.) The food was off the burner and resting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI came back to find my roommate hunched over the food, prodding at it.

She called me paranoid and an asshole. She's insisted multiple times that I'm acting like I'm better than her and that she would never do anything bad to my food. But I'm just grossed by the idea of her messing with my food at all, even if she didn't directly touch it. The food is sitting out there right now and no one is eating it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I'm refusing to eat food my roommate allegedly wanted to help with. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Just wanted to let you guys know the conclusion of this. I knocked on my roommate's door and offered her the food. I tried to explain to her that I wasn't trying to make her feel bad and that it was just a germaphobe issue. She did not accept the apology and only came out to throw the food away. She's hellbent on making herself the victim here and I simply don't have the energy to fight her on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Hey, it's been about a day and I just wanted to clarify a few things. For starters, my roommate does have diagnosed mental health conditions that she honestly struggles with. Some of her symptoms are poor impulse control as well as the hygiene situation. SHE IS NOT A BAD PERSON. She's struggling. Please try to remember that I can only give you a snapshot of a moment and not her entire story here on Reddit. I am by no means a perfect roommate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not moving for another 8 months. I know a lot of you think I need to leave ASAP, but that's just not in the cards. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also not diagnosed as a \"germaphobe\". I have an anxiety disorder. I'm sorry to everyone I offended by the term \"germaphobe\". I wasn't trying to disparage those with OCD. I just thought colloquially it would be acceptable to get my message across. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, why did I make this AITA post? I made someone cry. I'm sorry if I didn't get across the point that she really does have mental problems. I thought the hygiene issue alone would show that she's not well. But I genuinely feel bad for picking at someone who is struggling when I had the option of keeping my mouth shut or just saying I wasn't hungry. With my anxiety disorder I cannot help but obsess over my actions, and hearing her wail and sob in the next room over makes it much harder to process. \n        ",

This dates actually _way_ back but it still keeps me up at night and my sister is still guilt tripping me.\n\nI'm 27, F\n\nA bit of background:\n\nThis happened when I was 13 and my little sister was 8. And to put it plain and simple: at this time we absolutely hated each other. She was pretty spoiled being the youngest and according to my parents their smartest and most hard working one deserved all the extras she got. And told her that.  Which turned her entitled as well. \n\nSo she believed she had the right to order her older sisters around, and turned really mean when we refused. Which is what I usually did, hence she hating me as much as I hated her. \n\nWhat actually happened:\n\nI was told by my father to babysit her and then come and drop her off at his office. It's not far away, just 5 minutes by bike. We live in a region with quite some hills, and the route to the office has steep parts. By far the steepest one is right in front of or primary school. My sister managed this one on a daily basis so of course I wasn't worried about the ride. There are also zero cars on this route. \n\nEverything went fine until the last downhill part. To even call it downhill is ridiculous as it is really only half as steep as the one in front of the school, and instead of 100 ft it's only about 50ft long. \n\nBut my sister refused to bike the lane down. Told me it is too steep. She then refused to get off her bike and push her bike instead. Because it was too steep. She told me to take her bike and push it down, because of course I wasn't allowed to ride it down either, because I was old and heavy (I was about 70 pounds). And she wouldn't watch my new bike (>1000$) either because she didn't trust me with hers. \n\nI flipped her off and told her to either just leave her bike were we were standing (or uncle lives right next to the office, it would be on his lot) or bike down. \n\nShe looked utterly pissed and just drove off. And without even attempting to break hit a low stone wall.\n\nOf course I was down there immediately and tried to help, but I turns out that my dad saw the crash. He literally kicked me away from my sister, kicked my bike for good measure and took her away to the doctor. \n\nHer epiphyseal plate on her left hand was damaged and she got a plaster for 2 or 3 weeks. (Fully covered by insurance)\n\nI was not even allowed to defend my point of view and got grounded and nasty looks until the plaster was gone. \n\nAnd my sister and parents never stopped dropping snide remarks or generally holding this over my head. \n\nSo yeah, that's the story. I never actually told anyone about this, but after 14 years I'd really like to know what other people think of this. \n\nEdit: thank you for adding your points of view to mine. I have been unsure about this for quite some time. After all, if they keep guilt tripping me, there must be a reason, right? It's nice to know that there are people out there who agree with my inner voice that keeps saying \"no, it's not you\".\n\nBut for completenes's sake and for honesty's I think I do have add that my sister did have the uncanny ability to get hurt when I was watching her. Like a split lip when she was hoseback-riding on me (playing cowboy back when we still were friends) and I'm pretty sure she got a scar above her eye from when we were playing the floor is lava. So I guess my dad just snapped, it was NOT an everyday occurence. It _was_ the last time I got to watch her. Also in my area it was perfectly normal to watch your younger siblings at my age.\n        ",

Now that they\u2019re older and slightly more independent (4 and 6) it\u2019s as though she\u2019s reordered her priorities to back before we had kids. \n\nA few examples are she\u2019ll get dinner for herself but choose somewhere with all very spicy food and no kid friendly options. Our kids like a lot of healthy foods that take literally minutes to make. They\u2019ll eat most raw veggies, grilled chicken, turkey and cheese sandwiches, scrambled eggs, you don\u2019t have to make each one an elaborate personal meal. \n\nWhen I confronted her on this she said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to forgo the meal that I want just because it\u2019s not their taste. Their kids. They can adapt their taste.\u201d She knows they can\u2019t tolerate spicy foods yet. She didn\u2019t even attempt to get them plain bean burritos or anything. \n\nThe oldest recently went to day camp for the first time over a school break. My wife dropped her off *3 hours* early so she could take a yoga class. My six year old had to sit in an office with no campers or camp activities, just a secretary who didn\u2019t know what to do with this very early kid. Again, when confronted she said, \u201cSomeone was watching her. I called and they said it was ok. Why should I miss my class if they could take her?\u201d\n\nWhat set me over the edge and started this fight is my wife was doing some paperwork and one of the kids fell, hit their head, and needed to be consoled. She waited to console them until after she had finished her paperwork, even though it had no deadline or anything. \n\nI\u2019m afforded the option to work remotely, so I handle most of the childcare, it\u2019s not at all as though she doesn\u2019t have the chance for personal time. \n\nI\u2019ve brought up my concerns kind of passively again and again e.g., \u201cHey, maybe next time you could take a later yoga class or miss a day. It seems like she was very scared and upset by arriving so early with no one to talk to and nothing to do.\u201d Or \u201cIt\u2019s important the kids get something they can eat, no matter what else is going on.\u201d I\u2019ve also tried to start open ended conversations about the dilemma in general, but she doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem the way I do. \n\nAfter the consolation incident, I took her aside and said \u201cLook, you and I don\u2019t come first anymore. That is the responsibility we took on when we had kids.\u201d She said she gives them everything they need and I got frustrated and said \u201cParenting is way more than just keeping them alive. What you\u2019re doing by ignoring their crying so you can finish a form when you want to is a selfish abdication of responsibility.\u201d \n\nThat really set her off and by the end she said she needed some space from me tonight. I offered to go to a hotel but she insisted she go instead, which I take as a bad sign as to how wildly I screwed up.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for cancelling my spring break trip because my friends were being irresponsible and inconsiderate. | \nI (20m), decided to throw out an idea with my friends when we were deciding to do a spring break trip. My mom lives in LA, and I thought it would be cool to go and stay with her, and explore LA together. We live in Texas, and it was between that and South Padre Island. Obviously we we\u2019re poor college students so we were just gonna have to drive. \n\nThe cracks started the show the literal week before the trip. Up until that point I got together an excel sheet with every possible cost and event. We had even agreed on going to disney when we got there. Its what convinced them in the first place to go. I even tried moving the trip around so we could stay until friday (which was when clubs were open), since they wanted to get drunk and crazy. Then they got me to hang out with them, and started to run me down multiple questions about the trip. Involving what exactly would we be doing and if disneyland would even be worth going to LA for. \n\nThe concern was reasonable ofc but this close to the trip? I had already gotten my car checked and had one of my family friends to let us stay in arizona for the night since driving for 19 hours was impossible for any of us. It was even worse when they told me they were planning on telling me that they we\u2019re going to cancel on going, but I had \u201creconvinced them to go\u201d. This made me so mad considering they gave me their word they would go, and I had put so much work into it \n\nIn order to make sure everyone would go, my friend made us buy our disney tickets, so there would be money on the line ($104). I was iffy but went through with it. \n\nThen the day came, and I woke up at 6:00AM and called them to make sure they were awake. No answer. I kept getting ready and called them again 30 minutes later, no answer. This went on,  7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, and finally they woke up at 11:00 AM. I couldn\u2019t deal with this anymore. They had apprently went out again last night, and had forgotten to put alarms. There was no way we were going to be able to leave and make it to our destination on time, and now my mom is trying to frantically find a plane ticket to get me to LA because she wanted to see me badly. I couldn\u2019t try to even trust these people to drive my car, they have just fully been terrible about all of this.\n\nWhen I told them I was just going to cancel the trip, they began calling me inconsiderate for making such a big deal for such a \u201csmall mistake\u201d, and that the disney tickets were unrefundable so we had to go. That we could have just gone tomorrow. AMIT for calling it off after all of this? I feel like I was being taken advantage of at this point, and I couldn\u2019t imagine going on a trip after seeing how irresponsible and reckless my friends were being\n        ",

He said this is his full-time job and I'm not a revenge person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI (23F) live in a city where the mass transit is pretty good. Occasionally I get a Lyft if I am going somewhere unfamiliar or I need to get there fast.  I was planning on going on a date to a bar a few nights ago, but both of us got out of work late and were pretty tired.  Instead, we planned a spa-night at his place. I decided that since I didn't know how to get from his apartment to the subway, even though they're close, I would get a Lyft since it was getting late.\n\nI got picked up at my house by a male driver who was maybe 30 and there were two other women in the car.  It was a fairly pleasant ride while the other two were there--lots of great conversation about where we were all from, what we all do, etc. I mentioned my date and how excited I was for it. About 5-10 minutes from my drop-off, the other two get out.\n\nImmediately I could feel a massive change in tone and energy in the car. We stopped at a light and he started to turn around to look at me, saying how much he liked me, how great he thought I was, that he could use more people like me around. I mumbled a \"thanks\" and tried to change the subject. I really thought I had made it clear I was not interested, but uncomfortable.\n\nI thought he past my drop-off and I texted my date saying he needed to wait for me in the lobby, then opened the app to make sure he was on track.  I'm not sure if he actually did take a longer route, but we were on track by the time I looked. I was ready to get out if we weren't.\n\nHe pulls up really slowly to the apartment building, asking if \"it was cool if we stay in contact\" and go out. I blurted out that my boyfriend wouldn't like this and ran to the building. He didn't pull away until my date opened the second door on the inside of the building for me.\n\nI told him what happened in detail and he was LIVID. He said I should report this, that it was harassment and that this man was in a power position over me. He was easily twice my size and was driving me around a part of town I was unfamiliar with.  I kept saying no, I didn't want him to get in trouble and I would feel bad. He stood firm and said that if this man had done it before, he would definitely do it again.\n\nIt has been a few days and I still feel really icky about it. It put such a damper on my night. I know it is dramatic, but it took me awhile to come down from it and relax.  All I wanted was to have a nice night with this really great guy, and I was uncomfortable for like an hour before I could completely calm down and enjoy it. I'm not even comfortable enough to use Lyft anymore.\n\nI really don't want to ruin this guys life. WIBTA if I reported this incident to Lyft?\n\nEDIT: I should also say I'm scared to report this since he literally knows where I live now; I didn't say that it was my house, but thats certainly the vibe I would've gotten if I had been the driver.\n        ",

They fight about the same things all the time and it's just a vicious, repetitive cycle. They become verbally abusive to each other and have gotten physical in the past. \n\nIn the 3 months I've been living with them, maybe 4-5 times I've been watching tv when he's come home. He usually gets home around 4:30 but sometimes shows up whenever. One night around 7:30 my mom and I were sitting in the kitchen and I put a hockey game on, he came home, didn't say anything to either of us, walked to the couch, picked up the remote and changed the channel without even asking if we were watching anything. Another time I was off work for the day and it was 2 in the afternoon and he came home and went upstairs for the rest of the night apparently because I was watching tv, but if he said he wanted to watch I would have had let him have the tv. My sister made a huge deal that I was in his space and shouldn't be watching tv, and my mom said whenever he comes home I should just go to the basement. I said it's unfair that everyone should have to bend to his will just because he gets upset at the smallest things, and he could just say he wanted to watch tv and I'd have no problem. My mom agreed with me that he was being ridiculous and rude, and I said I would not let him get whatever he wants just because he's a baby about it. \n\nSo fast forward a bit and the 2 of them were fighting again and he called my mother a whore among other things, I guess my tv watching was somehow a part of it as well. They got into a massive fight when I was out of the house for an entire day, my mom said she ripped his shirt and the dog gate to the kitchen was smashed and she told me I had gotten my wish because he might never be coming back. Shame on me for thinking my mom had finally come to her senses because it lasted about 2 1/2 weeks and then a couple days ago she told me he was coming back and all of a sudden was framing it like me watching tv was the only reason they had fought and I was the issue. I told my mom I'm just not going to up and leave whenever he gets home, and if he wants the tv and I'm watching something, then he can say so and I'll have no issue. Apparently this was way out of line on my end and now my mom is telling him she hates me, that I'm lazy and I deserve nothing. I'm really confused by this 180 because she had no problem agreeing with what I said 2 weeks prior, but now her and my sister are painting me as the villain.\n\nThis morning he tried to tell me that what him and my mom had was \"different\" and that he cares for her deeply, and I can use whatever I want, but to understand that it's his space. I told him \"I don't care for you because you called my mother a whore\" and left, he hasn't said anything to me since and my mom hasn't spoken to me since he came back and I'm left wondering how I'm the bad guy\n\nSo AITA?\n        ",

I live in the UK and recently married an American woman (40F) who has 4y/o twins who moved here 2 years ago. Me and my ex-wife split up about 3 years ago but we\u2019re on really good terms and I consider her one of my closest friends. My wife moved in with me just before the wedding, 3-4 months ago. She was living quite close and we basically lived together anyway but due to work and both of us having kids, it was just a bit of a wing it situation each week.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s my upbringing and culture (think fairly middle class, small town in the South) but we all drink a fair amount, my friends, family, everyone I know and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any more than your average Brit. My wife isn\u2019t a huge drinker compared to us and says she drinks about as much as a \u2018normal American\u2019 so she had a bit of a culture shock when she moved here.\n\nIt\u2019s relatively normal for H to have half a pint of beer/small glass of port or perhaps a small glass of champagne during big occasions. Pretty similar to me and my friends as a kid and again, similar to my kids the same age in my family/friends circles. E has reached an age now where most of her friends are drinking, she\u2019ll have a few ciders/light cocktails on the weekend at home and normally have a glass or two of wine at a restaurant or a pub. There\u2019s been big functions like birthdays, Christmas etc where she\u2019ll be a little drunk off like 5-6 ciders with her friends/cousins. So far it\u2019s always been family/friends events so we\u2019re there to make sure nothing gets out of hand.\n\nHer school friends don\u2019t have the \u2018drinking vodka in a park\u2019 approach like most young teens in the UK do (or used to until recently?) and it\u2019s a lot safer with less alcohol than when we were her age. They\u2019ll have a few drinks at a friend\u2019s house where parents are there or a large party every month. Parties are the only time she's properly drunk strong liquor like vodka (1 drink/2 shots in front of me at most). I\u2019ve bought her cider, wine, 20% Malibu etc. to have with her friends. Me and my ex-wife always make sure she\u2019s safe, WE are her parents and completely in agreement over raising both kids on this issue.\n\nHowever, my wife has become really freaked out about it and says it\u2019s really dangerous, weird and she feels really uncomfortable and makes me feel like a terrible parent when this is the norm for me and seems a lot safer than the American approach. I\u2019ve tried telling my wife that there\u2019s other countries/cultures with lower rates of alcoholism where we\u2019d be seen as strict. She\u2019s said she feels it\u2019s unsafe around her kids but I\u2019ve said I won\u2019t ever overstep those boundaries and won\u2019t give them any alcohol unless she agrees and at 4 they have no idea about alcohol and how old you have to be to have it, we can just say \u2018you\u2019re allowed when you\u2019re older\u2019 but so far they haven\u2019t asked/shown they understand it.

When it\u2019s working well you get a nice zipper system and more orders can be placed.\n\nThe problem is once you commit to a lane there are still 1-2 cars ahead of you yet to make their order and you can get unlucky and be held up depending which one you pick.

Originally, the plan was to make the event a potluck. We\u2019re all moms and we have favorite dishes to bring to events, and we\u2019ve known each other long enough to make our potlucks successful. The friend, we\u2019ll call her Amber, hosting the party felt that since we always do a potluck for our get-togethers, we should cater food this time.\n\nThis was met with some resistance from the group because that\u2019s not our style. We are pretty low-key people who just wanted to let the new mother-in-law know we\u2019re happy for her. Anyways, so a member of our group offers that we should split the cost of the food. We were sent the menu which seemed simple with appetizers, a couple entrees, and two desserts. We supposed that was fine, and we tentatively agreed.\n\nA week ago, I asked her how things were going with food planning and she said she hadn\u2019t ordered the food yet. The party is tonight, and when talking to her yesterday she said that it cost her $650. Since it\u2019s too close to the party, it\u2019s too late for us to cancel the caterer and just go with a potluck instead. It comes out to $80 a person, which is a lot!! All of us are from different socioeconomic statuses, and I\u2019m about average, but two of the people in the group are in really dire situations, like barely supporting their families, living paycheck to paycheck. It\u2019s not something we like to address because we don\u2019t want to make anyone feel bad for their lack of privilege. I didn\u2019t want them to feel like they were stuck paying this amount because of the social pressure of not seeming well-off.\n\nI decided to take one for the team and expressed my frustration at the outrageous amount of $80 per person when a potluck would have provided a similar amount of food for less than a quarter of the cost per person. I said we should all just contribute as much as we can because it\u2019s not our fault Amber decided to go with such an expensive caterer. I asked Amber why she went with a caterer that was so expensive and she mentioned that she had originally planned on paying all of it anyways. She then took offense to my reaction and said that she doesn\u2019t need me to pay for anything anyhow and that I can \u201ckeep my money\u201d. Now, it looks like I\u2019m TA because I can afford it, even if begrudgingly, and I\u2019m the one making a big fuss.  I later messaged her privately and told her I\u2019d pay my full portion, but that it wasn\u2019t fair that she expected us to have a normal reaction especially since we\u2019re pretty aware of each other\u2019s financial state. But now she\u2019s mad at me, is refusing my money, and I don\u2019t even wanna go anymore to this party. I don\u2019t wanna be an even bigger asshole and not eat because I didn\u2019t pay or eat despite not paying. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation. I probably will go though because the party gal has no clue what\u2019s even going on, and I love these friends.

We didn\u2019t end up eating more than a fourth of the food, and even after taking some food home, there was still so much left over. She just didn\u2019t stick to the menu at all, adding in a million additional options.

My grandparent is well off so that\u2019s why I get large savings but  my mother is too stubborn to ask for their help. \n\nMy mum admitted to taking over \u00a35000 from my savings over the past 3 years without my consent. She has only said once that she\u2019s taken out money for rent in all those years. \n\nShe\u2019s now angry at me for saying it\u2019s unfair to take out my savings when it was never her money in the first place - if it was her own money she was putting I could care less but it\u2019s my grandparent\u2019s, therefore she shouldn\u2019t touch it. \n\nShe argued that it was needed, which I understand, because she had bills, debt and rent to pay. She then says it\u2019s also because I never help out around the house and because my father doesn\u2019t help out with child support. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be as angry if I didn\u2019t know for a fact she spends around \u00a3150 every month on clothes and shoes, then other money on weed, alcohol and cigarettes. \n\nNow she says I\u2019m overreacting over it being taken. And that I shouldn\u2019t be so stingy over money since I\u2019m just being selfish and self-absorbed, and that she\u2019s just doing what will help us the most. \n\nShe also said she\u2019d pay me back before I go to university. But considering she can barely pay rent and doesn\u2019t pay back her debt I\u2019m doubtful. I hate to say this about my own mother but it\u2019s true. \n\nAm I the asshole for being angry for at her taking a large amount of money from my savings account (which isn\u2019t her money) without me knowing?\n\nEDIT: After looking through my bank statements it seems she\u2019s taken out a total of \u00a36500 - 6 years worth of savings. Last night she tried to justify her actions by telling me it\u2019s all my fault because I never helped her out with chores and that I was upset because the total money in the account is less than expected. While I\u2019ve tried to ignore all her previous physical and emotional abuse towards me in the past 5 years, this really was the tipping point. I\u2019m currently talking to my grandparents on making sure she won\u2019t be able to access the account anymore. Thank you for all the comments of informing me what I should do, they\u2019ve been very helpful! :)\n        ",

Also, this is a throwaway account as a couple of people know my real username. So, for a bit of background info, I have been with my girlfriend for just over 2 years and I'm very happy with her. A few weeks ago I was in Waterloo tube station in London and made eye contact with an attractive girl while on an escalator, this happened a few more times with her smile growing bigger each time our eyes met. When we got off the escalator (she was a little ahead of me) she approached me and we began talking.\n\nI considered telling her that I was already with someone, but I found it kind of fun to relive my days as a single man for a brief period, also, something like this has never happened to me before so it was quite exhilarating. After a couple of minutes she asked to exchange numbers which I did to keep up the illusion. We said goodbye and later that day she texted me, so I replied saying that I was already with someone and that I was sorry for misleading her. I also said she was very pretty, and if I was single I would have asked her out in an attempt not to hurt her feelings. She seemed to find it quite funny and texted back saying I had nothing to worry about, we haven't spoken since. I considered the whole thing to be no more than window-shopping, as I had absolutely no intention of cheating on my girlfriend. However, my friend said this was much worse than window shopping and a form of emotional cheating. So, AITA? \n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for abandoning my cat? | My sister got me a cat maybe about half a year ago. Her name is Decaf and I really really love her. My brother who I live with does not.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been coming home from work to find Decaf outside or in the back shed, super dirty and full or bugs, fleas, mites, etc. It always stresses me out because I get home at like 2-3 am from work and then have to go and look for my cat. I asked my brother and sister in law to to not keep the back door open because she always finds a way outside. They said they\u2019ll try and it seemed to work for a few days, and I would come home to find her waiting for me and I would cuddle with her. I should also state that she\u2019s really affectionate and loves pats and rubs. She never bites, scratches, or hisses at me. \n\nToday I came back home again, I didn\u2019t see her at first but I didn\u2019t mind since she\u2019s sometimes sleeping under the bed. I texted some friends then started calling her name. When she didn\u2019t respond I started getting stressed out, checking around the house and seeing the back door was open again. I open it and shout her name but I didn\u2019t hear a response so I search the house again. As I go outside to look again, she comes inside, but immediately wants to go out again. I try to pick her up but she hisses at me, which stressed me out even more. My brother comes to see the commotion since I was being loud shouting her name and stuff (it\u2019s 3am). I argue with him about keeping the back door open and he said it was really hot and it\u2019s selfish of me to have a cat. He could have opened windows or the front door but instead kept open the only way my cat gets outside. Anyway, Decaf runs to my room and I still can\u2019t pet her or touch her at all, like she doesn\u2019t recognize me. She hisses and bites every time. I just grabbed her with a towel over my arm so she couldn\u2019t hurt me, and let her outside right now. I feel like it\u2019s really stressful for me to keep trying to find the cat every day, after working 8 hours. And now school has started for me, I have to be up early too, it\u2019s not like I can be up all the time keeping her clean after I find her. She kept scratching and her tail was full of fleas too when she came into the house. I spent a lot of time and money on her, buying her lots of toys and playing with her and cuddling with her and I feel like I can\u2019t handle the stress of regaining her trust and keeping her clean with both school and work. \n\nAITA for not wanting to keep her anymore?\n\nEDIT: I let her back inside, will be taking her to the vet tomorrow for a check up. Thanks to everyone for telling me off, after reading the replies I knew that I couldn't abandon her like that and it was stupid of me. I want to continue caring and loving her, and will try to a) secure a better (larger) room in the house so I can just keep her in that room and b) get more time off work so I can care for her. If I can't I will find a better home for her.\n\nUPDATE: I took Decaf to the vet, and it turns out she doesn\u2019t have fleas, but she did have other bugs crawling through her fur. She\u2019s since gotten a bath a week early Cheristin application. she also warming up again and letting me give her belly rubs and play with her. There\u2019s no apparent injuries or pain according to the vet.\n\nI called my parents early this morning, and asked to move into the larger room my brother has his kids\u2019 toys in. She agreed to let me move in there (though my brother doesn\u2019t want to let me). Turns out he\u2019s leaving the country in 2 days, so she told me to just move in after he leaves and she\u2019ll talk to him about it.\n\nJust to clarify, I live with my brother, but not in his house. It is my parents house, though they are out of the country most of the time and he likes to act like he\u2019s the owner (he\u2019s 12 years older than me). My parents agreed to let me have a cat when my sister gifted her to me, and she is taken well care of and always has someone around when they are here. I will be taking the advice of a lot of people here, and keep her in the room we are moving to, but not the rest of the house where she can run away (it\u2019s large so she will have room to play). I\u2019m also trying to arrange more time off work to have the ability to keep taking care of her.\n\nI normally let Decaf roam the house when I\u2019m not home and it has been fine until recently. My brother and his family don\u2019t hate the cat, they just don\u2019t care for her, and basically live their lives as if she doesn\u2019t exist. I don\u2019t think they would bully her, but they don\u2019t care if she runs outside or anything because they don\u2019t care about her (hence why they\u2019ll keep the back door open even if I asked them not to).\n        ",

It's like the screws just wouldn't come out of the car. Since they drove 2 hours to come get this car, they asked if they could take the car home still, then mail me the license plate once they were able to get it off. I hesitantly agreed (although I now regret the dumb decision). \n\n\nI waited about 2 weeks before reaching back out to the buyers to ask if they had the chance to mail my plate. The kid who's parents bought the car for him said that they weren't able to get it into a shop to get the plate off yet, but will soon. So I waited another week and reached out again, just to recieve another excuse as to why they hadn't yet been able to send my plate back to me, so I told him that I needed it by the 20th of this month. Another week goes by, so I reach out again, reminding him about the 20th, but he said that they still weren't able to get the car into a shop, but he was going to try to bring it in the next day (this was about 2 or 3 days ago). \n\n\nWould I be an asshold for threatening to report the plate as stolen unless they mail it to me within the next 5 days? \nI realize that I never should have agreed to letting them drive off with the plate on, but they seemed like genuine people and I figured that I have his name and info from facebook messenger (through which I've been contacting him), so it wouldn't have been an issue. I take responsibility for this, but I just don't know what else to do from here aside from threatening to report the plate as stolen.\n\nEdit: Due to what's going on right now, all DMVs in my state are closed unless you make an application. However, you can only make an appointment for title transfers, driver's license, and two others, none of which include anything to do with license plate registrations, so it looks like I may be SOL for a few weeks.\n        ",

I told her I didn't like it and stated why. My reason was it was extreme and it reminded me of a rebellious teenage youth going through a phase and it would not suit her at all. Myself and my partner are almost 30 years old and have been together for 5 years. We have a son and we both work professional jobs and the hair colour is fairly extreme. She's going from a beautiful brunette to red and orange.\n\n I would never tell my partner what she could or could not do but I've told her numerous times I may not be happy with certain decisions she makes. Of the two of us I am the more level headed. I plan and think things through whereas she jumps head first into almost everything and she would agree.\n\nMy partner has stated before that she feels stuck in a rut at work. She doesn't like her job but I think it's mainly because a lot of her friends (ex colleagues) without children and at home responsibilities have moved into other roles across the country and she feels she has been left behind.  I asked her if that is why she is doing something so extreme to sort of stand out among the crowd and she said no. \n\nFast forward to today and the conversation came up again after she reminded me of her appointment. I said to my partner I do not like the hair. Do not be upset with me when you have it and I do not like it. She accused me of being nasty and we argued a little. I told my partner I don't believe she will suit that hair colour and that I think she's quite selfish for telling me she doesn't care what I think about it she's doing it.\n\nShe had our son (I am a step parent but I consider him my own) when she was 19 years old so missed out on a lot of her youth and I believe she's trying to recapture some of it certain ways. We've argued before about me being boring because I don't like to go out to nightclubs and drink excessively like I did 8 - 10 years ago when I was a teenager. I have explained to her I'm over all of that and clubs are full of kids that I just don't want to be around.

He did relapse once a few days ago and it landed him in the hospital but seems to have scared him straight. He has been massively more involved and apologetic about everything. He is a completely different person when he\u2019s not drinking. I\u2019m a bit apprehensive, but so far things are going well. He also went to the doctor and got some meds to help with his withdrawals and to help with his blood sugars as he has struggled with his T1 diabetes since quitting drinking. He says keeps busy helps him not have cravings, so maybe he will keep up helping more. And he has done way better with the baby. Holding him more, not getting annoyed when he cries, all that good stuff. I still take him over night, but I\u2019ve been worried about my milk supply so that\u2019s why. Anyway, fuck the people who made rude ass comments about me getting pregnant, it was my choice and your comments helped in 0 ways. Thank you to everyone who gave advice and support. \n\nSo my bf and I (28M, 27F) had a baby last February. Long story short I do 99% of everything, and not just for the baby. I help take care of (feed and take outside) his dog, even though he doesn\u2019t help with my cat at all. I do most of the cooking, he has cleaned dishes maybe 2-3x upon my request since we moved in together over a year ago, he also only does laundry if I ask and never puts his own laundry away. He doesn\u2019t make the bed, doesn\u2019t do general cleaning around the house unless it gets *really* bad, and even then only does it after he has nagged me into also cleaning, and lets his bathroom get so bad that mold grows in the toilet. I confronted him about this once before and he claimed that he did most of the cleaning in and I was the one that wasn\u2019t helping. I stopped and bought about it and decided that, at the time, maybe he had a point. I hadn\u2019t really swept or mopped or dusted, he took care of the garbage, and really all I did was dishes, laundry and cook, so maybe it was more even than it seemed, and my pregnancy hormones were just making me antsy.\n\nWell, since the baby was born I made a chore chart, mostly so I could feel good about myself when I kept up well on the house. I wanted the positive reinforcement of seeing all the boxes ticked off on my chart every day/week. But, it also revealed the fact that my boyfriend literally does not help unless I ask him, and that\u2019s entirely unfair and incredibly exhausting. I do, in fact, have things I would like to do besides take care of our baby and clean our house, so I stopped cleaning, and the house became a disaster, and we cleaned together, and it fell back apart, lather rinse repeat. \n\nSince we are breastfeeding I try to accept that I will do a lot more of the child care, but I get up every time at night for the baby, I change almost all the diapers, I am the only one who bathes him, feeds him, changes his clothes, etc... I have pumped milk in the freezer, so my bf can feed our son, but if that doesn\u2019t settle him down then he just puts him in his bassinet or swing and lets him scream. He will go days without even holding the baby if I don\u2019t make him, let alone not changing diapers. I\u2019m really, really angry and disappointed about it, and while I love my boyfriend deeply, it does make me question the relationship and worry for the relationship that he will one day have with our son. He\u2019s so reliant on me to do everything that his name isn\u2019t even on the birth certificate because he had to fill our a paternity affidavit, and I literally cannot do that for him, so it didn\u2019t get done, \n\nI feel like I need a break to get a bit of perspective and cool off, so I\u2019m thinking of asking my dad if I can stay with him for a few days. I haven\u2019t yet, but I\u2019m thinking of it. More than anything, I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s wrong of me to impose on my dad but using him to get away from my problems.

        "input": "\n        scenario: WIBTA if I didn't give my cousin the money from her graduation gift | I bought my little cousin a very nice and very generous piece of jewelry for her high school graduation a few weeks ago. Our grandmother recently passed away, and had given me, as well as my sisters, the same item (a watch) for our high school graduations. So in my grandma's absence I gave her the watch, a simple and classic style Movado that set me back \\~$500USD. It was significantly more than I have ever spent on a gift, but felt that this was an important occasion and this tradition was important in my family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a week ago I'm checking my online banking, and I notice a chargeback on my card from the store for the full amount of the deposit (I financed the watch and would be making payments). Thinking it was a mistake, I called them and asked to speak to the manager. Wellll..... It turns out my cousin came in the very next day and returned the watch. The manager also added that the greeting card I had given with it was still in the bag and my cousin had left it behind asking if we wanted that back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt so hurt. I didn't even know what to say. I felt hurt that she couldn't be honest with me about how she felt, I felt hurt she clearly didn't value my generosity, I felt hurt that she returned the item the next day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to yesterday: My aunt calls me up. She explains that my cousin had returned the watch as she felt uncomfortable with how much I had spent on her, and felt that she had no need for such a nice piece on jewelry in college. I said I was hurt but that I understood. My aunt proceeded to say that, however, she has a lot of things she needs like new clothes and dorm stuff and she could really use the money. She proceeds to say that she's talked to my cousin and it would be great if I could just Venmo her all of the money I spent on the watch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so floored. If I had wanted to give her a cash gift I would have, but the only reason I spent that much money is because my sisters and I have all gotten that same watch from our Grandma and I didn't want her to feel hurt or left out. I thought it would be a nice surprise, but it was a lot for me and I had financed it, and it would be really financially uncomfortable for me to cough up such a large amount of money in one month. I let her know this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told all of that to my Aunt, and she proceeds to call me an Indian Giver and say that's disgusting, that I can't just not give my cousin a gift because she didn't want the watch, that I was ridiculous to give such an expensive piece of jewelry to a teenager, and that I should be proud of her for being responsible enough to want to spend the money on things that are more practical for her in this stage of her life. She said that it was incredibly tacky and selfish to get her so excited like this but then change my mind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo WIBTA if I didn't give her the money?\n        ",

Similarly I also got eidi (eid money) to get whatever I want. So I collected eidi from every relatives and thanked them kindly and stored it. Its about 500$ usd.\n\nSo in my country in that much money you can easily get a good PC for high end games and basic editing or animation stuff. So I told my parents I am storing my money in my cupboard (I told them exactly where and no one else) and what I will do with it.\n\nThen we went into hard times financially but not that hard that we would need to leave home or won't have food. Like one of those times that if you budget you could easily survive with all the bills paid but my parents like to get takeaway or dineout often which is extremely expensive in my country. (like really expensive).\n\nSo my parents asked me for some of my money and I asked what got and they said for usual bills. So I initially was willing to give them money but when I asked for details they became dismissive and I decided to not allow them to take my money.\n\nSo the time comes for me to go buy a PC. I open my cupboard and count my money. There is a 100$ missing. I immediately go to my parents and ask them who took it because only they have the key to my cupboard except me. At first they hesitate but then say things were financially hard so they took my money.\n\nI asked them again for details but they ignored me and pretended I wasn't even talking. My mom said she will return me my money in 2 weeks. I was OK with that. 6 weeks go by and my dad just got off the phone with a local shop that sells mobiles.\n\nWell I asked him why would he need to talk to a mobile phone guy considering he just got a phone upgrade. He then tells me he is getting my mom a new mobile. Initially I was happy but then I remembered that my mom said she would give me my money so I ask him about it.\n\nHe then pretended I didn't exist which made me mad and I went to my mom and asked her about my money. She said they don't have any money they are still struggling financially. I tell her about how my dad   is going to buy a new phone which costs around 100$.\n\nShe immediately goes to the kitchen to make food and when I ask her again she pretends I don't ask and like I am invisible.\n\nSo later I see dad put the 100$ in a cupboard. I warn my dad that I will take that money if he doesn't atleast tell me he wi return my money.\n\nHe again pretends I don't exist and puts the money.\nThat same night I went and took the money and hid all of my money in a secret drawer i built myself that no one knows about.\n\nThe next day he wakes up and sees the money is not there and I tell him I took it which makes him mad and he tells my mom which makes her mad too. \nSo now I am typing this post after being screamed at for 1 hour. \n\nAITA for stealing?\n        ",

When I cleared my college entrances last summer, I could have gotten into a few good colleges (***not the best ones though***), most of which were expensive AF. I understand my parents aren't loaded and need to save money. Although they never directly told me, I knew they were struggling with this descision, as they couldn't afford these colleges.

The sheer lack of opportunities is very frustrating. I constantly see my friends posting about the fun stuff they do at their colleges and mine has none of that. I'm disappointed beyond the point of complaining. I just killed my future before it even started. \n\nAnd my parents know this. I know they are not to be completely blamed for it, but it just sucks that they didn't give me that. All I wanted was a normal college life, like everyone else. But because my parents couldn't afford it, I'm restricted, disppointed and constantly depressed. I've told them about this and they always blame me for not working hard enough to get into the **top colleges** where they actually would have considered shelling out the money. We've had mutiple arguments about this and I can only do so much to keep myself ahead of the crowd.

It was $800 a month for a room in the basement and a private bathroom. That included utilities and internet. Only other stipulation is she would need help feeding her kids (13f & 15m) here and there.\n\nWhile I worked 2 jobs I wasn\u2019t exactly rolling in dough as both jobs weren\u2019t great. As time goes on I go from feeding her kids sometimes to being the one to feed them and if I didn\u2019t then they may not eat. It got worse to the point where I was working 2 physically demanding jobs on less than 1000 calories worth of food a day. I was literally starving and trying to push what I could to feed the kids. I worked my ass off trying to find a better job and was able to get something finally.\n\nSuddenly the person paying the internet bill decided he wanted to move out with little warning and it fell to me to take care of it. When he came back he never took it back over. So now I am paying close to $900 a month plus a massive food bill. My sister has been asking me if I want to live with her because she knows I\u2019ve been in a bad way and my depression is getting worse since I could no longer afford therapy. April rolls around and it\u2019s time to renew the lease, the roommate who invited me is lamenting she wants to move out but is trying to find someone to take her spot.

She made as much as I did before being on disability so why was I paying $300 more than anyone in the house on top of food costs for two teenagers? Add on the fact that she has Ipsy, other subscription boxes and constantly getting packages from Amazon but can\u2019t feed her own kids even the basics. \n\nI say nothing but decide since it turns out I was never added to the lease I can go whenever.

She is mad I would leave them in the lurch like this even though I gave her so much time find someone else to move in.\n\nCome October she lets me know she and the others were abandoning the house. I know she blames me moving out for the upheaval (they did find someone else to take my room but they weren\u2019t willing to take the extra responsibilities).

And that it\u2019s scary hearing his dad argue with his mom. He\u2019s about to be a teenager and I just said \u201cyour mom and dad are adults and should handle themselves better than that.

Every time she calls, there\u2019s an argument between the two of them. So I said, new rule, take that shit to the garage when she calls. He thinks I\u2019m asserting myself and not letting him discuss matters with his ex in his own house, because it was my house previously. Told him I don\u2019t give a shit about him discussing matters with his ex, but I\u2019m tired of hearing them arguing in front of my kids and his own, and that is just going to be how it is here from now on until they can get it together. \n\nHe\u2019s angry with me. I\u2019m getting a \u201cit\u2019s not your business\u201d vibe, which he hasn\u2019t said, but anyways, I felt like I had to do something.\n\nUPDATE: kid free last night (yeah!) and we had a chance to discuss our argument. I was demanding and patronizing, and apologized. We eventually came up with a different plan. \n\nWe spoke with his attorney this morning, and he\u2019s going write up an agreement prohibiting the type of bullshit detailed above. Custody agreement is already in place, and if we decide we want to deviate from that, it\u2019s up to the other parents discretion, but special consideration be given to things that benefit the kids. If the matters are financial, we\u2019ll let attorneys handle that. We plan on asking her to meet with her to discuss in person. I suspect she\u2019ll decline, but we will make sure she knows that if she does decline,  the attorneys will handle. No more petty bullshit. \n\nAs for the comment about who\u2019s house it is. He admitted that there are some insecurities. Poor guy was raised with some pretty strict gender roles being reinforced, and brought up education and my career. (Y\u2019all, he is quiet and reserved. For him to say these things was shocking) He is more intelligent than me in countless ways, and works his ass off taking care of me and all of our kids. The way he has accepted my girls, and tries to take care of things is just...I can\u2019t really express it. Hurtful to know that he feels insecure sometimes, but hearing him open up in that way was refreshing and...attractive. I like him pretty good, and will definitely keep him. \n\nTherapy is happening all the way around.\n        ",

My neighbour of 4 years has a severely autistic child (he\u2019s 12), I mean, he is non verbal, goes to a special school etc. He is very, very loud. Constantly. Now during the week he is at school, so no noise. But when he is home, my god we know it. He screams, bangs, hits the windows, when he\u2019s out in the garden he throws things over the fence, not like little plastic toys, like huge bits of broken brooms, pieces of furniture, buckets etc. He has damaged our fence panels from throwing himself into them.

They agreed with me and asked her if she even tries to prevent it and she said no. This pissed me off. Not even trying!!

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for shaving my wife's cat? | 7 years ago, I bought my wife a Maine Coon kitten for her birthday. Maine Coons are very big and have long hair. She's an indoor cat, never goes outside. About a year ago, she started having frequent hairballs. When I say frequent, it's rare to go more than 2 days between hairballs. She usually coughs one up and then a while later coughs up the rest of it, so it's more like two a day when she does have them.\n\nWe've tried different cat foods, medications, additional grooming, everything imaginable with no luck in reducing the number of hairballs. The vet asked if we had ever considered shaving/trimming her, and my wife said that wasn't an option.\n\nI've been suggesting we shave the cat for the past month or two, even showing her pictures of Maine Coons with Lion Cuts and other creative styles. She's 100% against doing anything at all other than regular brushing. She says the cat is a long hair, and that's how she'll stay. She also says it's winter, and you can't shave a cat in the winter (remember - indoor cat, it's never colder than 70 inside). \"If I wanted a short-haired cat, I would have asked for one, not a Maine Coon!\"\n\nOn Saturday, my wife had just left for a baby shower and a few minutes later the cat puked. I cleaned it up, and 30 minutes later she puked up another hairball right after she had eaten so it was huge mess. I cleaned it up, took the cat into the bathroom, and shaved her. When I say \"shaved\" I used the 1/16\" setting, so she still has hair, it's not bare skin. I also left the hair around her face, paws, and tip of her tail untouched - basically a Lion Cut. It took me over 2 hours, and it looks like a professional did it. Honestly, it looks just like the pictures that groomers post on their websites.\n\nThe cat has been awesome since I shaved her. Not a single hair ball. She's more active, stays around me and my wife almost constantly, always purring, eating better, etc. She's like a brand new cat.\n\nMy wife still hates that I shaved the cat, despite the huge improvement noted above. She says I had no right to do that to her cat. She's virtually not talking to me now, complaining on the phone about it to all of her friends, etc. She's a very unhappy wife right now.\n\nHere's why I feel I did nothing wrong: my wife has **NEVER** cleaned up a single hair ball. Never. Not one. She says she can't because they make her gag. She'll throw up if she tries. She claims that she absolutely cannot do it under any circumstances, so I have been cleaning up multiple hairballs every week for the past year. I've come home from business trips and found hair balls covered with paper towels that I then have to clean up.\n\nSecondly, after seeing the improvement in the cat's health and overall happiness, I almost feel like a bad person for not doing it sooner. I simply don't understand why my wife can't see the improvement and agree that I did the right thing. Apparently, I'm still a huge asshole, despite the happier, more active cat.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Apparently you have to post pictures if you mention a cat on Reddit. I\u2019m still learning, maybe this will work: [https://imgur.com/a/5HLxDls](https://imgur.com/a/5HLxDls)\n\nFINAL UPDATE:\n\nThanks for all the comments, y'all! Lots of great info, suggestions, and thoughtful critiques of how the situation was handled.\n\nWife and I had a nice talk over lunch today. I admitted that I was wrong for shaving the cat while she was gone, despite doing it for what I felt was in the cat's best interest and my best interest. It was selfish, and I could have handled it differently and probably achieved the same outcome. \n\nShe admitted that she was being unreasonable and stubborn by refusing to consider having the cat trimmed, and she apologized for not realizing how frustrated I was getting over the constant cleanup duty.\n\nI understand that some people would think she's a bad wife and pet owner due to my post, but let me clarify that she is both a wonderful wife and pet owner. We've been married for 12 years, together for 17. We've had pets all 17 of those years, and this is the only real conflict we've had. She also cares for the cat in every other way. Hairballs are literally the only thing she doesn't do, and I've never thought she was faking her aversion to them - it's a real thing that she just can't handle. It's all good.\n\nAs for what happens next...we've agreed that we'll let the hair grow to the point where she starts having hairballs again, and then take her to a professional groomer for maintenance grooming, not shaving/trimming. We do groom the cat regularly. She's never matted or out of control, but many of you suggested that professional care can work wonders that you just don't get through day to day grooming. If that can keep the hairballs down, awesome. If not, we've agreed to trim only as short as needed to keep hairballs under control, hopefully not the 1/16\" that I did this time.\n\nThanks again!\n        ",

Me answering: I don't know), etc. \n\nNow I live with my loving husband and daughter, and have a tentative relationship with her because of my sister and dad.

It was a thoughtful present and one that was meaningful to her. It was late because it took my mother all summer to find an Alexandrite ring that she thought my sister would like. Alexandrite is a rare and expensive gemstone so finding something took some time and energy.\n* March 2019 - I turn 30. I received a card, present to follow. She said she was going to send me flowers (I \\*love\\* getting flowers so much - even cheap grocery-store daffodils) after I got back from a weekend trip to Banff. She didn't remember.\n* This weekend - In conversation with my mom I ask her if she forgot about my birthday? She insists she bought me winter tires for my birthday and will check her visa records. For the record, I BOUGHT my *own* winter tires and she realizes, after checking, she didn't get me anything.\n\nTuesday, she asked what I would like and I told her I wanted a ring (For fine jewellery I prefer rings because I find I'm often prone to losing an earring). I said I saw a photo recently on pinterest that I liked and she asked me to send it. I did - see [image 1](https://imgur.com/a/1vDc1LB). She said it looked expensive and I agreed - she asked for the inspo, though, and it was just that. Inspiration for what I like - green gemstone, rosegold setting, minimalist-y design.\n\nLast night she says she's found something, can I take a look. She sent me back this - see [image 2](https://imgur.com/a/1vDc1LB). I don't want to exaggerate but I think this might be among the ugliest rings ever made. I texted a photo of the ring and convo to my sister who said she'd try and help guide our mom towards less ugly choices. My sister and I have noticed that, like, mom's kind of uninterested in me of late because I have not born forth children - get a bit of that red-headed stepchild treatment.\n\nI know that I'm not entitled to a present especially a pricy one (though let it be known that my parents are people of means). But I'm annoyed that my 30th - which is a milestone for me - didn't warrant them consciously thinking of a thoughtful present and that I had to remind them. But on top of that it clearly doesn't mean enough for her to look for something I'd actually like. AITA for feeling disappointed?\n        ",

My fiance has worked extremely hard planning this wedding. She is planning the majority of it, as well as paying for most of it as our families are not well off, and she's the breadwinner. It's a very important day for us. I understand something will always go wrong at a wedding, and it'll never be \"perfect\", but as long as it's with her I'll be happy. \n\nShe gave me one task for the whole wedding: Make sure my groomsmen are matching. Simple enough. I found some slacks online for 40 bucks and told my groomsmen they could wear whatever they want for a shirt, but the pants must all be the same color. I sent the link to them for the pants 5 months ago and it seemed everything was in order.\n\nI just got a message from one of them saying he blew it, and he \"wished\" he'd  had an excuse, and he needs the link for the pants again. That's fine, but then he messages again saying he already has pants of that color anyways and he'll just wear those. I tell him as long as they're the EXACT same color, and to check with another one of the groomsmen who lives near him to see if they match. He responds jokingly, and now I'm concerned that he's gonna show up to the wedding in completely off-colored pants. If that is the case, I don't even want him up there. He was already extremely difficult during the bachelor party, and generally had a bad attitude because I didn't want to order strippers. He is my longest childhood friend, and it'd suck for him not to be up there with me, but his selfish behavior has only gotten worse as we grow older.

I'm not into sports. Dirk Nowitzki announced at their last home game that he was retiring. We watched the ceremony at his last game on TV and she cried a bit. I dont get the emotional attachment but she cares so I care about that. We watched his last game yesterday and while she didn't cry, she was super emotional about it. As some back story, her mom passed away when she was 14. She hadn't been into sports outside of tennis but ended up watching basketball because she briefly had to stay with her siblings while her mom was in the hospital since her dad would work and then go to the hospital. After her mom passed, she threw herself into watching and cheering for the Mavs. It was the first year they went to the finals (2006) and even though they lost, she says it gave her something to look forward to and was a bright spot in a really rough time. She's been a huge fan ever since. \n\nFast forward to this morning. We met up for breakfast and I brought up possible trips for next year. She then informed me that we might have to push back our trip.

She told me she would love for me to join her (she'd pay for both tickets) because its important to her. \n\nI'm annoyed. He didn't die. He just won't be playing anymore.

I also don't understand the big deal behind retiring a jersey.

A girl, Sara, took to the group chat and asked if anyone would write her lab report for $100.  I got kinda pissed about this...the rest of us were spending 10+ hours on this report, why should she get out of it and get a good grade just because she can afford to pay somebody else? I started paying attention to the chat a little more and Sara kept asking for answers to quizzes and saying awful things about the professor and blaming her for how hard the class was. This is my biggest pet peeve, esp bc our prof was *way* nicer than most, it really set me off and I went back and took screenshots of all the times she asked for answers and the time she asked if someone would write her lab report. Note: she negotiated price, they worked out a place to meet up, that was not a passive joke. \n\nWhatsApp shows your cellphone number and you get to pick a username; she put her full name in. This was last spring semester, I let it go for a while. I have her in a class again this semester, and she's not dumb, just lazy. But I see her doing the same thing, she cheats on half the assignments. Found out she's got a ***3.9 GPA.*** That's unheard of at this school. \n\nOur school has a zero tolerance for plagiarism; if you're caught with damning evidence, you're expelled. Degree progress revoked. Assuming her MCAT is fine, this girls got her pick of the litter for med school; she's got tons of volunteer and shadow hours, even research. Loads of free time when you're not doing your own work after all. Obviously that goes bye bye if she's expelled.\n\nI still have all the screenshots. More and more I want to report her, mostly because I'm bitter about how much better her app is than mine, which makes me feel like an ass. \n\nAITA/WIBTA if I reported her for buying her lab report\n\nEdit: most of our classes are curved to some degree. Her doing artificially better for cheating does negatively impact other grades, particularly on one class where only 90th percentile of students get a 4 for the class\n\nEdit 2: this girl and I are applying to different schools (she's going MD and I want to do DO) but when I say I'm bitter about how much better her app is, I don't know if this makes a difference but it's because I think it's unfair that myself and other students should be compared to her when she's got an unfair advantages. Kinda like steroids in athletes. \n\nAlso this was a pattern of cheating, she's done similar in this class as well (though not in a group chat, I've just heard her talk about it bc we're in the same lab section)\n        ",

On his end I can\u2019t get one till I\u2019m 30 (um, ok.. dad?). On my end, it\u2019s got to be something small and where people can\u2019t notice it easily.

We have certainly had our issues, but this is the first time I'm making a post here. Throwaway acct. Sorry for the novel. \n\nMy bf was playing music, so I'm dancing; we're laughing and having a good time. Then I go to play a song, and start dancing a bit with my hands still on his desk. He gets mad and snaps at me to stop shaking his desk. I'm like \"oops, sorry!\" and we continue\u00a0on with the night.\u00a0\n\nAn hour or so passes, and I remember I need to scan a copy of my car payment receipt. I pull it out and set it on his desk. It was wrinkled so I start trying to flatten it out and he says \"Stop..STOP\" and I guess it took me a second to register that he was telling me to stop. He snaps at me, I kinda apologize and walk away. Truthfully, I know this apology wasn't very sincere because I thought he was freaking out for no reason. I didn't think I was even shaking his desk this time. So my attitude probably escalated things to start.\n\nI sit down and he is getting on to me for not listening. I start to defend myself, but stop myself. As I am saying \"nevermind\", he points at me and shouts \"DON'T\". I get upset and say I'm not his child and he doesn't get to tell me when I can/can't speak. He starts saying that I didn't have a defense, so he shouldn't have to listen to it when I'm the one in the wrong. I said something like \"you don't get to dictate whether or not I have a point, especially if I haven't even said it yet. AND I was already stopping myself anyways so you jumped the gun and barked an order at me for no reason\"\u00a0\n\nHe then says something like \"What am I supposed to do when you are shaking my desk and not listening? Take physical action??\" and I was confused by that. Then a bit later, he's like \"You're lucky all I did was bark an order at you\" and I start freaking out asking \"What does that even mean, is that supposed to be a threat?\" and that really pissed him off. He took this as a personal insult/stab against him.\u00a0  \nSide note:\u00a0\u00a0He has never hurt me.\u00a0I have been in an abusive relationship and was also abused as a child by men. My bf knows this. I was trying to explain that I didn't actually think he'd hurt me. But when men get loud or make statements like that, it brings back memories and I freak out.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHe still didn't get it. Scoffed and said something like \"You can probably stop assuming I'm going to physically harm you\". When I asked what he meant by his \"You're lucky all I did was bark an order at you\" statement then, he said \"I could have barked 2 orders. I could have barked 3 orders..\"\u00a0By the end of it, we agreed in the future he should just reassure me that he didn't mean it like that and that he'd never hurt me.\n\nBecause I have had certain experiences, I tend to panic in situations that may not warrant it. Were the statements he made actually threatening, or did I blow this out of proportion? AITA?\n\nEDIT: I appreciate everyone taking the time to read and provide insight.

TV shows, movies, video games, she has no idea about anything that isn't a non-fiction drama, and considers it nerdy, confusing, and below her. She claims it's because she was homeschooled and sheltered, but so was I, and I caught up and kept up with pop culture just fine.\n\nShe also hates \"nerds\", which she has described as what are incels and NEETs to the rest of us. Fair enough. But that means that any time any of our friends talk about anything currently relevant, she'll jokingly call us nerds and berate us for it.

We'll be like, \"Hey, going to see the new Star Wars in December?\" \"Oh yeah, I'm a big fan of Daisy Ridley,\" and she'll interrupt us with a bellowing, \"NEEERDS!!\" or scoff and act like we're doing calculus in another language. \n\nIt's reached a point where we have to act like old ladies around her. After the last time she called us a bunch of nerds, I snapped and told her, \"Look, we aren't talking about anything 'nerdy'. You just refuse to participate in society.\" She just kind of quietly laughed it off, but I feel like that may have been too harsh and I hit a nerve because she really did grow up with crazy strict, religious parents. AITA for snapping at my friend and telling her to participate in society?\n\nedit for info: I should have added, I said \"society\" instead of pop culture specifically because she also doesn't know how to do a lot of basic adult stuff like cooking, managing your own finances, etc. She's definitely pretty, and usually gets by on credit cards and sugar daddies. So anything considered nerdy is beneath her. She is a kind, bubbly person in all other regards. Should have included that in the OP, sorry.\n\nfinal e: Thanks for the judgement everyone!

To those of you equating her to a slut or an entitled b!tch strictly because of her lifestyle and not her actions...don't be weird.

Always fun games and trivia and it has become a staple of our friend group's holiday traditions. I think its important to note that this party ALWAYS takes place on his actual birthday and it is always hosted at his house.\n\nThis year he sent out an invite as usual and his birthday falls on a Sunday.\n\nMaybe 2-3 days later I get another invitation from Tom's GF, Julie(19f). Its an invite for a surprise party. I think this is a little weird but assume its a small event for close friends out at a bar. \n\nI check the Facebook invite though and see that she has invited the entire party. I also notice the location is set for Tom's house and the date is a DAY before his actual party.\n\nI'm pretty confused at this point. I'm not really sure what the point is in having a surprise party a day before Tom's event that he looks forward to every year. I'm also worried that this change in plans will stress Tom.\n\nI'm not the only one confused as people on the invite list message me asking for clarity and eventually a group chat gets started with our close friends on how to handle this situation.\n\nWe eventually decide its probably best for me to message Julie and try to see if she would be willing make the surprise party a smaller event at a bar so Tom can still have his event as planned.  We write up a very nice message to send that is supportive of her idea while also firm that we think this would step on the toes of tom's party.\n\nNo dice, Julie completely ignores our carefully crafted message and tells us that she thinks Saturday would work better and we will do everything Tom had planned for sunday... on saturday. I try to negotiate further but there is little budging.\n\nAt this point the groupchat is divided. Some just want as little conflict as possible and are willing to move mountains for Tom to make sure he is still socially comfortable and traditions are maintained. Others are wanting to boycott this party and view it as another power move from Julie which she is somewhat known for.\n\nI see both sides, I know Tom would just want as little conflict as possible but I also know he is someone who struggles to find confidence and this party is always an event where he is truly in control. \n\nIts also become my job to use the key Tom gave me to let everyone in to his house. I am just feeling way too involved for something that I don't fully support. I can't help but feel I should send Julie one last message with a more blunt tone.

I'll admit it was my bad for not asking her if she was ready to deal with a rant today- usually I do ask. Today, everything came crashing down, and I started spilling it all out. I'm not looking for advice or anything. I just needed her to tell me everything was going to be okay. She told me to indulge in the things I usually do in order to calm down.

I don't feel like what I said to her was rude, but obviously she feels like it was. She told me being depressed is not an excuse for being rude towards other people. Was what I said really that assholish?\n\nUPDATE: It appears that yes, I was an asshole. Thank you to everyone who let me know, I genuinely appreciate it. I also want to clear something up that is making me look like more of an asshole than reality. I do not, and have not ever forced my girlfriend to deal with my depression.

She\u2019s in middle school so sometimes she can be a handful between dance, soccer practices, homework, and boy and friend drama. Her mom has chosen not to be in her life (drug addict after getting prescribed with painkillers) and we don\u2019t have any family close by except for a few of her uncles, so I feel as if I am the only one shouldering the \u201cpseudo-mom\u201d duties. \n\nMoreover, I\u2019m not entirely sure how or why, but his daughter wants me near her all the time and wants me to be the one that soothes her through everything.

But, I also want to bring more equality in. Not sure how to feel about this.\n\nEdit: I wasn't going to add this in the interests of keeping it as neutral as possible. But...\n\nI'm male. I kind of want to see if this changes anyone's views.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for saying no to major chores while wife enjoys holiday overseas? | Sorry for the formatting, my first ever post and its from my cellphone.  \n\nSo a couple of months ago it was announced after 20 years with same company I would be made redundant. This was meant to be a good thing as i could spend the summer holidays with our daughter (5) who had started school for 2 weeks then hit the summer holidays.  I've never had a chance to have time off with her before. Instead my wife announces we are going to China (where she grew up and her parents still live).  She knows I do not enjoy visiting,  especially mid winter.  She talked me in to it by saying we would travel, which I am keen to do, great wall and terracotta warriors specifically mentioned.  Once the trip was booked she says.. \"oh we wont be able to see those things the weather makes travel hard, but we will do day trips out to other cities\".  Even that I could handle, but the day we arrive she days we wont be doing that either.  What happened was just as I feared (and as usual) I'm left to look after daughter in a small apartment in winter, while my wife relaxes in her old room, watching tv, making models and lego (her hobbies), being pampered by her parents and having lunches with her friends.  I had organised to return 5 days early to home, knowing I would want some time too.  It is now a few days until I leave and she has handede a list of chores to do like wash our house, move furniture, stuff she wants done, and will take most of my time. I said no, she will have had a months holiday doing everything she loves, while my few days are filled by tasks she wants...  I also pointed out she had denied me a month of summer holidays with our daughter (yes ive had lots of time in China with her, but stuck in a small apartment vs parks and playgrounds back home is not even close to the same).  I am now getting the cold shoulder and feel so isolated in a strange boring place.  Am I the asshole for wanting a few days to myself after the last couple of months I've had?\n\nUpdate:\nHey all thanks for the comments so far.  Just to clarify, I agreed to the holiday believing we would travel out of town.  This is not usual behaviour from my wife, hence I am so caught out, and am unable to travel myself as I can speak very little Chinese. I also have a new job lined up in the new year.\n\nFurther update:\nHey all thanks for your comments and feedback.  To clarify, we are staying with my in-laws.  We visit China regularly, and they visit us each Chinese New year, and of course have taken the little one out the the malls and local area.  Major learning for me on description in my posts.  Also we live in the southern hemisphere, hence summer holidays atm.\n\nThat said I take on what people say about putting my foot down and could have owned the situation much better.\nHave talked it out and agreed to tackle the chores together when everyone is back. Apparently the planned trips fell through and she just majorly downplayed it, falling back in to her comfort zone.  I'll take a more active role in planning our next trips here.\n\nAnother update:\nThank you again for the feedback, for those who think this is a bogus post, have added a pic link taken out the window this morning (not that it proves too much, but hey). We are in Shanghai, so not isolated but have done this area to death.  Making the most of what I have (I should have made that clearer) but it is limited, was just annoyed to then be asked to give up my own small amount of time after how things ended up here. As I say above, have now talked it through.\n\nOk Google drive was folly, open to an easier way to share in future....removed link, not that fussed if not believed.\n\nLast post here.. again thank you it's been great reading the comments and I'm trying to take them all on.  Have a great Xmas all.\n        ",

It's only recently that she seemed to reject the idea of this.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not buying my husband a foreign candy he asked for? | Last summer, my husband and I made plans for a vacation to his home country, which I've never been to before. Towards the end of last year, he was laid off and didn't find work until January. His accrued vacation time (which would've covered our trip) at his old company did not transfer over, and his boss did not feel very charitable about letting the new employee take a vacation. I have done a lot of solo travel and really enjoy it, so he decided to refund only his ticket, saying that I should get a vacation even if he can't come.\n\nBefore I left, he asked me if I would stop by a local shop and bring him back a candy that he has been unable to get since moving here. Of course, I promised him that I would. My flight left last Thursday, and I had a blast. I took loads of pictures, FaceTimed with my husband plenty, and was set to return this past Wednesday.\n\nThe day I left, I decided to sleep in, because I just wanted to enjoy my last day of vacation. I put off my packing the night before, so when I got up, I took my time having some coffee and packing up. I didn't check how far the shop he had wanted me to visit was from the hotel and airport until right before I was leaving. It ended up that all 3 locations were in a weird triangle, the shop being the furthest from both the hotel and airport. It would add on a ridiculous amount of travel time that frankly, I didn't have, unless I wanted to cut it very close with security and risk missing my flight.\n\nI didn't mention it to my husband at the time, because I was hoping he would forget. He picked me up at the airport, we went home, had some dinner, and the next morning, while I was unpacking, he asked if I had put the candy in my carry-on or stow-away. I told him the truth, that I had run out of time and said that we could probably get it online. He got really upset. He said that I'd been careless not to check the location of the shop beforehand, and that I'd been really selfish in sleeping in and lounging around, which wouldn't have left me much time no matter where the shop was. I felt bad, because he hasn't been back since he immigrated here about 12 years ago. I told him, again, we could find it online, and he said that he's tried, but it's never panned out.\n\nI said that I was sorry, but told him that I thought it was rude of him to call me selfish and careless. I was just enjoying a vacation, which I deserved and which he told me to go on. He said that he had also deserved a vacation, but since he didn't get it, he only wanted some candies. He goes out of his way to do a lot for me, and was really charitable about letting me go on my own. But I think he's blowing things out of proportion and being unfair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for not buying my husband a foreign candy he asked for?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** I messed up. And I told him as much. He tried to apologize for being \"disrespectful\" to me but I was just being defensive at the time and didn't let him tell me sorry. I was unfair to him and I messed up on the 1 job I was given. We have been together for 15 yrs and he even left his home to be with me. At the very least, he deserves his candy. I think we have both been a little short about the situation because of his layoff, which derailed our plans to start a family. Our trip was supposed to be a celebration and the start of introducing our future child to his culture, but obviously, that didn't work out. I feel really awful, especially because I had somehow convinced myself I was right. I'm still trying to figure out how to make the situation better.\n        ",

So of course he is busy trying to make the right decisions for us, and can\u2019t really be bothered with making other types of decisions. I tried to talk to him about what he would like to do for his birthday and he just couldn\u2019t give me any answers. Fair enough, I totally get that. So I decide to make plans for him myself.\n\nWe have three kids. Oldest is 7 and youngest is 7 months. We can\u2019t exactly do things on a whim and need to definitely plan it out in advance, especially if we want to do it without the kids.\n\nSo I decide to get a sitter for Friday evening (he works Sat-Wed). I got REALLY nice tickets to a local baseball game (which he LOVES to attend!) I asked him BEFORE I bought the tickets if this is a good idea and he said \u201cyes thanks!\u201d GREAT! Green light given!\n\nThen I remembered that it\u2019s my Dad\u2019s birthday too (their birthdays are 4 days a part). They get along pretty well. So I figured, hey maybe two birds one stone? Neither my dad or husband like to be fussed about on their birthdays but definitely appreciate doing a little thing. So I asked husband if he would mind if I had my dad tag along with us for the game. He said he didn\u2019t care. I asked again, and said \u201cThis first and foremost is your birthday present, so I just want to make sure you are OK with this, it\u2019s your decision\u201d and he just kind of brushed it off again. I asked again a few days later. He responded he didn\u2019t care again. Alright, he can\u2019t be bothered to make these little decisions and he says he doesn\u2019t care, so I invited my dad. \n\nMy dad is VERY excited about going to the game too.

This morning, husband said to me \u201cHow about we skip the game, and go to dinner and a movie instead?\u201d I asked why.

He said \u201cI thought that was MY decision?\u201d I said \u201cWell it was, but you just kept saying you didn\u2019t care, and I figured you really didn\u2019t care, so I invited him\u201d\n\nHe stopped talking and just said \u201ck\u201d.

Thank you Reddit for helping me out!\n\nHey Reddit, I am at a complete moral dilemma right now and I could use some outsider input.\n\nMy son (16M) for the most part has been a great kid. He\u2019s done well in school and is the team captain of his basketball team. However, I\u2019ve caught him doing some troubling stuff such as drinking underage or making out with a girl.\n\nRecently, my son came to me and told me he\u2019d like to get something of his conscience. He proceeded to explain how 2 years, he used to smoke cigarettes quite often before quitting because he realized how harmful it was for you. He told me that he\u2019s kept this bottled up for a while and feels bad about hiding it from me.\n\nI thanked him for being honest, and told him that he was grounded for the remainder of the year. While he was honest with me, he had lied to me in the past about what he was doing and who he was going out with. I also think I need to hammer home the concept that cigarettes are not something to mess with and can seriously affect your life.\n\nHe started screaming at me about how he had done this while he was a child, and how he was completely honest with me so he shouldn\u2019t be punished. After cussing at me for a while, he stormed up to his room and hasn\u2019t even looked at me since.\n\nI am extremely torn on what I should do here. I do believe that smoking cigarettes deserves some sort of punishment, but on the other hand, I don\u2019t want to destroy the trust between my son and I. My entire family is conflicted on what I should do. My wife, MIL, and FIL are all telling me to not hold his past mistakes against him. On the other hand, my parents are telling me to punish him to really drive home the message that this will not be tolerated in this household. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for punishing my son for smoking cigarettes despite it being nearly 2 years ago?\n        ",

Side parts help camouflage it, and I like having one eye covered sometimes. \n\nWe were in church one Sunday and I stepped out to use the restroom. She followed me outside and told me to fix the wig while I was in there so the part was in the middle. I said no, because the side part worked with the outfit. She kept repeating it and repeating it. Finally, she said \u201cif you\u2019re not going to listen then give me the wig. You don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\n\nOk. \n\nSo I took the wig off and handed it to her. I went about my business and then went back into church with my braids very obviously exposed. A lot of people were whispering about it, and it didn\u2019t help that my mother walked in with it tucked into her dress pocket. \n\nShe said I embarrassed her and made a big deal out of nothing, that I should\u2019ve just listen when she said to  fix the wig. I told her I did listen, just not to the instructions she wanted me to listen to. AITA?\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for punishing my teenage daughter very harshly for catching her playing with a beer can? | TL;DR Yesterday i caught my (44M) daughter (14F) in her room toying with an unopened low-alcohol beer can. I then grounded her for 3 months and took away her phone for a month. She got really upset. I might've been too harsh, but i think it was necessary.\n\nYesterday, when I (44M) came home from work, I went to say hi to my 14-year old daughter, who was in her room at the time. I knocked on her door and opened it, and she yelled something like \"No, don't come in!\". After opening her door, i saw her trying to panically hide something (which would very soon be confirmed a beer can) that she had in her hands. I recognized it as a beer can and immediately started yelling at her asking what the fuck she had in her hands, and she just hysterically repeated that she wasn't drinking it. I ripped the can from her hands, and to be fair, it was pretty low alcohol (2.7%) and unopened, but she still shouldn't have alcohol at that age. (Well, she wasn't drinking it, but she probably would've, had i not intervened.) \n\nI asked her where she'd gotten it and she told me (although a little incoherently due to her sobbing) that her friend had given it to her yesterday, when they went out for fast food. I then asked her how long she'd been drinking, and she told me that she doesn't drink. And i normally would believe her, since she doesn't go out that much and when she does, she comes home at a very reasonable time. But i had caught her with a beer can, so i still don't really believe her. I mean, nothing stops her from drinking during the day when she's out with her friends. She was still telling me how sorry she was and that she wasn't drinking and that she was just playing with the can, same old same old. I told her that i don't believe her and that i will not let my daughter become an \"alcoholic bitch.\" (Perhaps my wording was too harsh, but sometimes you have to be harsh.) She was still trying to convince me that she wasn't drinking and she never would, but i'd already made up my mind: i took her phone, which was recharging on her nightstand and told her that i'm taking away her phone for a month and grounding her for three.\n\nShe was pretty devastated to say the least: she started crying uncontrollably, begging me and still trying to convince me that she didn't do anything wrong. I told her that my descision stands, and then came her petty insults and 'i-hate-yous'. I just told her that she gets what she deserves and went to my bedroom. We haven't spoken since.\n\nNow, i'm thinking of shortening her sentence, because it was pretty harsh. But imo some form of punishment is absolutely necessary, i'll not let my daughter become like my old man, who was a depressed alcoholic.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm getting a lot of notifications from you guys, but some of the comments don't get posted, and i think that's because of the b-word, bitch.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for asking a teacher to make changes to his recommendation letter? | TL;DRs after every block.\n\nHi, 17F, applying for college/scholarships specifically in computer science. There is one computer science teacher (40s-50sM) at my high school, and I've taken three of his classes across two years -- all As, the only 5 on the AP comp sci test from our school last year. I've also participated in/later held leadership positions in the coding and robotics teams he runs after school. Both of these teams have placed in competitions each year I've participated, after consistently taking last place in previous years. I also won two of the coding competitions individually and was the sole coder for robotics when we took first my junior year (last year).\n\nTL;DR All of that to say, I think I'm competent in comp sci, and this teacher is in a unique position to vouch for that.\n\nI asked him to please write me a letter of recommendation, and he said he was happy to. He did that for many members of our teams who were planning to go into computer science. I didn't opt out of being allowed to read recommendation letters before I attach them, and his is not really what I was looking for. In two pages, he references my \"beautiful smile\", boys in the class being \"no-doubt distracted by her beauty\" (??), me being an animal lover and me having a nice singing voice. He barely brushes on anything related to computer science or even my competence in general (I had the highest PSAT/SAT scores in our year too, which he knows), and includes a lot of irrelevant information. He references my appearance four separate times, and he only mentions the coding team as part of a story about me being happy to pet a dog that they brought after the competition -- making no mention of me winning the individual portion of the competition itself. It's not a mean letter at all, but I still think it hurts my chances if anything because it makes it seem like someone who's known me in a comp sci setting for years can't really speak to any abilities -- or even like I didn't earn my grades in his classes, which I know I did. In my mom's words, it makes me \"look like a bimbo\".\n\nTL;DR: Letter did not reference any computer science competency. Includes a lot of frivolous information, unintentionally makes me look ditzy.\n\nAnyway, he asked if the letter had made it to the system so I told him yes, and thank you, but that there were a few changes I'd like if that was alright. I explained what they were, and he got pretty offended and said he was doing me a favor, etc. I understand he didn't have to write me a letter at all, and I still appreciate the effort. I offered to rewrite it myself for him to submit so he doesn't have to put more time into it, but he declined. Am I the A for taking issue with a favor if the favor isn't actually helpful?\n\nTL;DR: Teacher got offended I asked for changes to his letter. AITA?\n        ",

The restaurant hadn\u2019t been open very long, but it already had a built in audience since it was part of a franchise. About 25 people answered. \n\nI am always the one that\u2019s on time, which is early for everyone else, and that day was no exception. No one was there, not even my friend, but still, I told the hostess that I was part of the group, and she told me that they already had the table waiting, but I must wait for my friend. That was fine, he got there 10mins later. He approached the hostess to ask her to take us to the table, and she refused. She said that she could only sit ya if there was half of the people he had reserved there. We were shocked, we had never heard of such policy before, especially at a franchise spicy chicken wings place, and also we knew that our friends were not going to be there on time. \n\nWe had to wait for an hour and a half on the sitting room. We saw how the place went from mildly busy to packed, and from the sitting room we could see our reserved table and how they never touched it. They just wouldn\u2019t let us go in until half the people were there. \n\nAt the moment I thought that it was because they didn\u2019t want the waiter to get confused on our orders, but turns out that\u2019s what he did later. \n\nMaybe having only 1 waiter for a 25 people table and have him still wait on his whole section wasn\u2019t a good idea, but he still made a lot of mistakes. If we asked for water he brought Coke and when we tried to send it back, he told us that it was already in the system and he had to charge us for the water in addition since he couldn\u2019t delete the coke. He did this with several items and people had to pay double for food they didn\u2019t order. The bill was astronomically high at the end of the night, and there was food on the table that no one touched because we hadn\u2019t ordered it. We asked to speak with the manager and he said that the waiter was right in how he had handled it, and there was no way to fix his mistakes. \n\nWe only paid for the food we originally ordered and left. \n\nThey tried to chase us down the street, but we were already on our cars and leaving. \n\nI\u2019ve never worked in retail or service, and whenever I tell this story the reactions vary between the people who have worked as servers and the one who haven\u2019t.

I don't get how it changes the situation or your take on it, but we are lesbians in a lesbian relationship.\n\nBasically, my girlfriend and I met at the tail end of a cross country journey that had me vagabonding through the United States, and upon meeting each other I was flat broke. I paid for our first date with a gift card, and while she thought it was charming, it was really just because I had nothing else.\n\nFrom then on, we moved in together in the same month (I moved into her apartment). She paid for all of our dates, and we moved across the USA to a northern state for her work. Since I was still unemployed, I had no reason not to tag along. Going forward, once we finally had our own place, I spent the next 5 months building a web design portfolio, taking HUGE jobs for pennies on the dollar, hardly making enough monthly to cover anything but my own expenditures.\n\nAt the end of 9 months, I finally got paid from my first job, which I wouldn't have gotten if I hadn't had the backup to support me while I built a portfolio. My job paid about 5x as much as hers.\n\nWe moved out of that house, and subsequently to two other states since then. We bought a class B RV together (in her name - I have piss poor credit), and now we live in it together. I have paid for essentially everything since then - gas, food, bills for the loan on the car, extra activities, and whatnot.\n\nNow, we're coming up on 6 months of me paying for everything, but the finances don't add up. I've spent THOUSANDS of dollars on things for us, and in retrospect, her spending over 9 months was significantly less. I don't have exact numbers, but when you make $2k a week and have nothing left in the bank, there's a problem. We just moved AGAIN, across the country, and it cost me about $3k just in gas alone, and we moved for her job.\n\nNow she's finally just gotten her first paycheck today, and the first thing I told her to do was to put whatever aside for her phone bill, and give the rest to me, which was only about $300. $300 hardly covers our groceries and her half of the RV loan bill. She put up a huge stink about it, saying she supported me and never asked ME for money, ignoring the part where I just funded our entire lives together for a half a year. I don't know what's gotten into her, but she seems to think we're going to go to TJ Maxx and get her new clothes for work, which is just NUTS.\n\nAnd all in this, I'm just trying to get back my half of the bills for this month alone, let the rest be bygones. I'm going spend whatever she gives me on birthday presents for her ANYWAYS!\n\nI've never made as much money as I do now, and I haven't had a single minute to enjoy it because I've been covering the costs of living for two. Am I the asshole for trying to get her to finally split the bills?\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend supported me for 9 months no questions asked, and I supported her for 6 (but paid a lot more).

I live in a large city so it was packed with people returning stuff and the usual shopping. I needed to use the restroom so I went to do that.   \n\n  \n  There was quite a line of people so I decided to act civilized and get in line. The man behind me had a kid (probably like 6 or 7) with him and was getting really upset really fast. While there was about 2 people a head of me a store associate came out and told us he needed a minute to clean the bathroom. Obviously none of use were happy but what are you going to do? The associate goes in the bathroom to clean it up. \n\n  \n  Almost immediately the guy behind me starts complaining very loudly how the worker was probably in there doing nothing and making us wait on purpose. To be fair the associate did take about 10 minutes but the guy was talking loud enough that I think the associate in the bathroom could have heard it fairly clearly. I worked retail so I know how stressed the holidays are on people so I texted my girlfriend telling her it would be a while. I also texted her, \"There is a guy behind me who is acting like a baby about having to wait. He is throwing a little tantrum that is kinda funny.\"     \n \n\n I get out of the text app and start browsing Reddit or something. The guy behind me starts really calling the associate names and generally being an asshole to the young guy who is just doing his job. I turn around and give him a look and he says to me, \"You shut up. I saw what you said about me, asshole.\"   \n \n\n So at this point I'm a little stunned because there must have been an effort to look over my shoulder and see what I was texting. That's kinda a huge violation of privacy in my opinion. I get a little pissed fast and turn to his kid and said, \"Santa Claus is not real. It's your parents. Also the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are not real. It's all your parents work.\" I walked away at that point because I didn't want a physical altercation to happen or anything.   \n\n\n  Am I the asshole? Maybe what I didn't wasn't proportional but I think it was if you have ever worked retail on the holidays and if I was the associate I would be cheering for me.  \n\n\ntl;dr: Stranger acts like an asshole to retail associate, reads my private text over my shoulder, calls me an asshole for texting that he was being a baby, I tell his kid that Santa isn't real. \n\nEdit 1: Thanks for all the feedback! It seems split 50/50 for the most part. Keep the comments coming!\n\nEdit 2: Didn't realize that so many tough guys were on Reddit. Noice messages! \n        ",

He also decided we should go to the ballet and picked the show. He knew he would need a tux for this event when we bought the tickets months ago. \n\nAlso I feel like I should note that we are not talking about typical urban American poverty. I\u2019m talking about rural, Appalachian poverty. House burns down in a kerosene fire kind of poverty. Moving to section 8 housing was a major safety upgrade (as in structural integrity of the physical building) kind of poverty.\n\nDetails: Partner and I make six figures, have no debt, and no kids\n\nAnyway... My partner grew up extraordinarily impoverished and he seems to view unnecessary spending and as a moral failing. I grew up upper middle class, and just don\u2019t get it. However, partner and I (usually) have great communication so we\u2019ve found a solution: our finances are combined, but I put aside extra money for things that are pleasurable. Since they come from \u201cmy money\u201d the theory is that he will be able to freely enjoy these things that (I believe) are worth the money. The account is literally called \u2018The Fun Account\u2019. We also agreed that he will not lecture or complain about my purchases under $10 (he consistently fails at this...)\n\nPartner and I have been planning a vacation for months. He has been crazy busy and I love vacations, so I have done all the planning, the only thing required of him is that he procure a tux and shoes to go with it. We leave in a week and he still has not done so. Great. At his request, I send him a list of potential renters. He doesn\u2019t like any of them (lots of excuses, but in the end it comes down to price) and seeks out the cheapest possible tux instead. I let him know that the quality level is not appropriate, and the sales person is trying to sell him a tux that is never going to fit properly (I sold high-end suits and tuxes all through college.)\n\nHe agrees to go somewhere else to try on others and to have himself measured by a quality salesperson. The main goal is measurements, so he can get the right tux SOMEWHERE. We leave and go to the other shop. Within moments of engaging the salesperson, my partner starts asking me abnormally aggressive questions, he\u2019s basically scolding me and saying I\u2019ve tricked him into the store, when he only wanted to be measured! I am trying to keep the (commission based) salesperson\u2019s head in the game, so I say that we\u2019re here to try things on, get measured, and see if he likes these better. At this point he seems to lose it and starts talking to me in a manner that is totally out of character. He starts accusing me of tricking him and of luring him here on false pretenses. These tuxes are too expensive. He wants to go to men\u2019s warehouse and have me buy a $200 tux instead (these are called \u2018service tuxes\u2019 and are meant for boys at proms and high-end bartenders. If you wear one where we\u2019re headed, you\u2019ll be mistaken for staff.)\n\nPartner is refusing to let the salesperson handle things and measures his own waist (why?!) but eventually he decides that he\u2019s going to try on tuxes here. Great. I have never been shamed like that in public before, so I am very upset. Public arguments are tasteless and grossly unfair to the people around you. It\u2019s a small shop, and the sales girls are desperately trying to avoid making eye contact with me. I. Am. MORTIFIED. When the salesman leaves, I let my partner know that the plan never changed, we\u2019re here to do exactly what we discussed and I don\u2019t understand why he yelled at me! I tell him that I\u2019m super embarrassed and I would like to call myself an Uber and leave.\n\nThis sets him off. Instead of calling me an Uber, getting his tux settled, and meeting me back at home, he gathers his things and storms out. He insists that he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, so we\u2019ve been living in silence for 12 hours. He still doesn\u2019t have a tux. We leave on Sunday. Wtf happened?

It eventually got really bad I had no support from my parents and they wanted me to either magically \"get over it\" or to take pills which I was completely adamant to. Anyway, many therapy sessions later, and moving out on my own helped me in improving my condition drastically. However, I still have certain aspects of it that I retain and not wanting people to come to my home is one of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's when my girlfriend comes into the picture. We've been together for about 2 years and I've always been open about my OCD and she has been overall very understanding and compliant with it. When I moved in with her, we had to share an apartment with a roommate. It was difficult for me but we didn't have too many issues because I didn't see the apartment and the things in it as \"mine\" so I never felt the need to keep everything clean and untouched, plus I knew it was a temporary situation so it was manageable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, we moved out on our own in an amazing apartment that I love and I definitely feel like home in. Shortly after, however, my girlfriend had to go back to our hometown to work for a couple of months so I've been living there alone throughout that time. Now it's time for her to move back in. I've told her that it's very important for me to keep the apartment clean and orderly which she isn't used to but I managed to convince her that it would not be that difficult and she's agreed to try. Another very important thing for me was that we never invite guests because of how much anxiety and stress this would cause me. Her parents aren't aware of my condition and she claims that they would never understand it and basically hate me if we told them they can't come over because I don't want them to. (Mind you, I don't want my own parents to come over either.) Now her dad insists on helping her with moving her things back in and bringing her whole family to come see the apartment because they've \"never seen it in person\" and maybe even spending the night there. I was terrified when I heard that and we got into a huge fight over it. I understand that she can't tell her parents not to come in and I will have to endure it but we got into other issues. She claims that she never thought I wouldn't want to have people over ever, only not often. Furthermore, she is upset that I'm being disrespectful to her parents and seeing them as \"dirty\" even though I've explained that it's not personal at all. She claimed that she never thought I would be so extreme and that when we discussed it earlier, she thought I wouldn't be asking for so much. Overall, it came down to her finding me too demanding and suffocating. I was really surprised because, again, we had discussed these things before we moved there and she said that it would not be a problem. Am I being too demanding or is it reasonable to ask her not to do things that I know cause me stress and anxiety?\n        ",

We all usually get on really well and have a lot of laughs together.\n\nRecently we decided to go on a camping excursion. For context, it's me, a brother (We'll call him Simon) and sister (Karen) who are quite new to camping, and a guy (Alan) who's a bit older and more experienced in travelling (as well as his pet furball).\n\nAlthough I've never really done camping before, I know I like to travel quite light. I carry all my own stuff as I don't feel it's right to burden other people with my things. For context, I'm from a rather wealthy family and I've always been a little mollycoddled, which I kind of hate, so I try to avoid burdening people as much as possible. My sight isn't great either, so my family have always been way overprotective of me.\n\nAfter carrying my stuff to the campsite, I was asked to help set up their tent by Karen. I reminded her that I was sleeping in my own tent and that I carried all my own things, so I felt it was fair that I set up my stuff and they set up their stuff. I even carried my own food! Karen started yelling at me telling me that they needed help and I should stop being so selfish.\n\nThat evening, to Karen's credit she came and apologised saying that we're all a little tired from the long journey to the campsite. I feel like she was trying to insinuate that we were both to blame by saying that we were \"all\" a little tired, which I felt was unfair, but I let it go for the sake of the excursion.\n\nLater, we had to move camp because some big lizards had started invading our area and again Karen demanded I help them unpack. Again, I reminded her that I carried my own weight. She started screaming in my face. When Alan tried to calm her down she yelled at him too. Later that night she was quite nasty towards me, even mocking my poor eyesight by commenting that it was a \"shame\" that I couldn't see the stars.\n\nNeedless to say, it wasn't the best trip I've ever had. I put her anger down to tiredness but a few people have said to me that I should have just helped.\n\nSo Reddit, Am I the Asshole?\n\nEDIT:\n\nT hanks for all the replies. Got a bit of a range on whether or not I'm an asshole so I concede that maybe I didn't go about it the right way\n\nO n the day we agreed we should all camp together, I was very upfront about the fact that I wanted to be quite self-reliant on the trip. I really wanted to go on the journey to show myself that I was able to be independent and look after myself, and that was my focus.\n\nP erhaps I should have made my desires more clear. I still think it is unfair to expect me to help, when I specifically packed light so I wouldn't have to spend a lot of time/effort carrying/setting up things.\n\nH owever, I also disagree with those who are saying horrible things about Karen. Although Karen is younger than her brother, she is like the mother of the group. She cares for us all greatly. She has a background in healthcare and I have voiced my appreciation before that she could help with first aid should any unsavoury situations arise. We were all quite sleep deprived and so I think she acted out because of that. She's really a gentle person. I'm usually more of the tough one. I perhaps should have just apologised.

I pretty much knew that they didn\u2019t live in our neighbourhood because I walk the dogs all around our neighbourhood and so while I can\u2019t name the street names of the top of my head, I would know them if someone said the name. \n\nI asked where that was and they said across the street. I asked \u201coh like from the park?\u201d They replied \u201cno, like in the other neighbourhood\u201d my boyfriend gave me a look and I knew he was thinking the same thing I was. We were kind of awkwardly quite for a second and then I said \u201cso we hate to be those people but uh, this is a private neifhbbourhood.\u201d  \n\nThe guy in the couple kind of shrugged and said \u201cokay\u201d. After more awkward silence my boyfriend said \u201cso umm, did you guys miss the signs?\u201d They asked what he was talking about and he mentioned the signs  that said residents and guests anyways. The guy said \u201cit\u2019s not like anyway cares right?\u201d\nMy boyfriend said \u201cwe\u2019ll seeing as I pay a fee to use these amenities and you don\u2019t, I care\u201d \n\n\n\nThe guy looked like he was about to say something The girl told her boyfriend they should go and her boyfriend said \u201cI mean what are they going to do? They can\u2019t really make us leave?\u201d The GF just leashed up the dog and walked off and her boyfriend reluctantly followed. \n\nI thought my Bf and I were in the right until I told one of my friends about what happened and their reaction made me second guess myself. Are we the assholes?\n\nTo clear things up because apparently people are missing the point of why we care so much. It\u2019s a PRIVATE community. We pay $350 a month for the amenities.\n        ",

So I was working part time at a shop close to our apartment and we were doing okay. My MIL was watching baby as I worked because I can't afford childcare. My MIL ended up getting a teaching position in the district so I had to quit my job to stay with baby and we started to get behind on bills.\n\nAfter a lot of thought my boyfriend and me and his family agreed it would be best for me to stay in Missouri to work at my old job over the summer and send my boyfriend money for bills until I can legally work as a beautician in Cali. Also, my credit is very bad. I've been running from debt for years and want to start paying it off to get a decent credit score. Since my MIL is a teacher, she will be off this summer and offered to take care of my daughter while I take care of my business.\n\nI trust my MIL and all my in-laws a lot, they are all really good with my daughter and my daughter always comes home super happy after spending a day with them. They are all super active people who will take her out to do fun things all summer, I'm so jealous of how much fun I know they will have.\n\nThis decision has been super hard on my family, my mom wants my daughter to stay with us and my whole family has been trying to get me to make arrangements to have my daughter stay with us this summer, but that would require me to find childcare here because everyone here is working. I've considered working this summer in Cali, but its hard to find a job out there, especially one that pays as well as my job in Missouri. I think it will be more effective if I just work hard to build credit. I plan on getting a second job here and stacking up money. My family is adamant that my baby needs her mother, I'm about to cry typing this out now. I will miss my baby but I am 100% confidant she will be in good hands with my in laws...also, my mom and step dad are borderline just no's...I caught my step dad giving my baby COFFEE the other day, and gatorade today...my mom is always wanting to give my baby unhealthy crap like mac and cheese and french fries and they always try and get her to watch tv and download games for her to play on the phone even though I really don't want her to have screen time. I really don't want to deal with them while I'm trying to get my life in order...My mom and I plan on going to counseling together this summer because lord knows I need it. We both do.\n\nI'm just scared my baby will forget me, I'm crying now, She's going to make her first steps without me around, She's going to celebrate her first birthday without me with her. I'm an absolute wreck whenever I think about it but I'm convinced its for the best. WIBTA for leaving her?\n        ",

She said since she helps out financially she is entitled to the room and casually threw in that her friend offered to let her stay with him and have her own bedroom, I guess she meant it was a threat?

I said sure, I live far from my family because of college and with her car I'll be able to go back home. All I had to do was drop her off at the airport and pick her up on Sunday.

About five minutes in an animal jumped to the road and I swerved to my left to avoid killing it and crushed into a parking car taking off both mirrors I left a note with my phone number and drove straight to an auto repair shop to fix my friend's car it cost me 500 bucks which is a lot but manageable and I thought fixing the other car would cost the same. I didn't tell my friend about the accident because 1. I didn't want her to feel responsible to help me pay 2. I didn't want to disappoint her.\nSo Sunday comes I pick her up everything goes according to plan but than the other car's owner calls he tells me he got a price offer of 3,000 dollars which I have no way of paying he says (and show me pictures) I hit more than just the mirror. He knows it's a lot so he'll give me a few days to come up with a better offer but he can't wait too long because his mirror is basically shattered.\nI felt like my life have been ruined I have no way off paying that amount of money I'll have to drop out of college and I'll probably be homles so as a last resort I call my friend and tell her everything. I say the amount is beyond anything I can do and I practically beg her to activate her insurance telling her I'll obviously pay the damage and the extra the insurance is going to cost her now. She took a few days until answering that she is very sorry but she can't help me because of some impact it might have on her in the future. I was pissed. she would not help me because it might affect her even though I bailed her more than once. Eventually a different friend called me yesterday he said he heard what happened and he can get me a much better offer (almost quarter of the original price) and it all turned out fine. So AITAH for holding a grudge against her?\n\n\nEdit: thank you all for answering!

We haven't been able to hang out quite as much since we graduated highschool last year, but we still try to find as much time as possible to get together and do stuff.\n\nThe problem happened at T's place. J needed to leave a bit early(by our standards) because he had an early shift the next morning. So it was just T and I after that, and we just went about our thing playing some video games, and BSing around.\n\nI noticed tucked into the side of her bed there was an eevee plush toy. I picked it up out of curiosity, because it was a pretty odd thing to find in her room of all places. We all loved pokemon growing up, but keeping plush toys or stuff like that was usually something we all thought was kinda silly. It then actually hit me that I'd seen this thing before. It was from a few years ago during freshman or sophomore year. T, J, another friend and I were at an arcade and I had won it from one of those stupid crane games. I was planning on throwing it out because I didn't care about keeping it, but on a whim I decided to ask T if she wanted it since I knew eevee was one of her favorites, and she ended up taking it. I figured she probrably ended up throwing it out, so I was pretty amazed to see it again after so long.\n\nI acted surprised and joked around with her that I couldn't believe she kept this thing for so long. She confided in me that she actually sleeps with it most nights, and I just sorta burst out laughing hearing that. I feel kinda bad for that looking back, but that's just so hilariously out of character for her. I wasn't laughing AT her, I just thought it was entertaining.\n\nShe told me that it's just because its special and holds sentimental value to her, and that it makes her feel less lonely at night since we haven't been hanging out much lately. Honestly it was kind of heartwarming, but I couldn't help but keep the joke going just a little and I said something about how I couldn't believe how sappy she's gotten. My mistake was probably when I mentioned offhand that I gave it to her because I was gonna throw it out anyway.\n\nShe out of nowhere just kinda blew up on me. She told me to go f**k myself, threw the thing at me and yelled that if it's just trash to me(which I never said) that I could have it back. I ended up being thrown out by her and before she closed the door in my face she threw the plush at me again.\n\nI do feel really bad about teasing her so much for it, and she seemed pretty upset, but she just acted so utterly crazy in response. I've never seen her act like this before(she's normally really chill) and I don't really know where to go from here. I decided to hold onto the eevee plush since I figured it'd probably help me make up with her, which I do plan on trying to do.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: I kinda figured I sucked a bit for it, but it didn't really occur to me for a while just how much of a douche I was for it. I never intended to make her so upset. I'm gonna take one of your guy's advice and buy her another plush and return the eevee one in the hope of making it up to her.

When my mom got better, my son landed a better job, saved up money, and prepared to move out again.\n\nMy mom then became severely ill with diabetes and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. My son stayed home, I left my job and withdrew my retirement money so I could stay home to provide the 24 hr care my mom needs. My retirement money has since run out and now the burden is falling completely on my son.\n\nMy siblings think I should be home caring for our mom and they said they would help, but since having this discussion they claim they do not have extra money or time. I\u2019ve been happy that they are successful and can afford many luxuries.

Yet they cry on the phone when discussing her impending death.\n\nAITA for thinking they should sacrifice a few luxuries in order to help keep our mom happy in her final days and/or the ones who live close by at least help with getting her to appts and taking turns caring for her while I work since they claim to care and want to be involved in decision making?\n        ",

I also received stocks which grew enough to the point that I was able to purchase my first home a year ago, and moved in last week. Prices for homes are inflated where I live and I was able to\u00a0purchase\u00a0a\u00a0townhouse\u00a0for a little over 600,000. A \u00a03-4 bedroom\u00a0detached\u00a0home is in the range of a million dollars.\n\nI threw a housewarming party and invited my family, including my sister (32) and her husband (35). My sister\u2019s husband did not have a job until he was 30 (when he got married to my sister) and as a wedding gift, his father gave him the downpayment for his first home which was around the same price as mine (although much bigger). \u00a0He flipped the home after a few years of its value exploding, returned his father\u2019s downpayment and purchased a beautiful home. My BiL also receives cheques from his parents each month on top of his salary (\\~35-40k a year) to help accommodate for their somewhat lavish lifestyle. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that, his parents want to help him, I'm just providing context onto how he might perceive wealth.\n\nAt the housewarming party, my brother in law constantly stated how my home was so cramped, and that he\u2019d never be able to live in a cramped townhome. I joked around at first, saying that we could maybe break some walls and make more room.\u00a0\n\nHowever, as the night continued, he kept stating this fact over and over again, even commenting on the small size of my master bedroom \u201cMy kids rooms are bigger than this.\u201d I continued ignoring it, but it built up more and more as an annoyance. I told him that his first home cost the same amount as this one, and that the housing market is just more expensive now. He shrugged it off and stopped for a while.\n\nAfter, as I was serving dinner, he commented to my sister (that I overheard) that everyone was packed in so tightly together in the dining room that I didn\u2019t need heating. It was the final straw and I called him out and lost my voice at him. I told him to get out, and asked if he needed help getting the silver spoon pulled out of his ass. He exploding back, called me jealous of his home, and told me to not vent my financial insecurities into him. I said that he was insecure in his finances for making comments all night, and couldn\u2019t manage without his dad\u2019s help. My sister started crying at that point, so I apologized to him, saying I\u2019d taken it too far.

My grandmother has had several health problems like a fractured hip, restless leg syndrome, little to no sleep and general discomfort with standing and sitting. \n\nMy grandma looks at two shirts with me and she wants to buy them for me as a special gift so we head towards the tills.\n\nOne till is a brunette girl with a semi long line of six to seven people, the second till behind her as only one person being rung through. Naturally we go to the second till (especially since the sooner I can get my grandmother out of the line the better). \n\nSuddenly the cashier at the till tells us we have to first line up at the semi long line then we can be redirected here. Not a big deal and fair right?\n\nSo we start walking around to the line and two people walk right up to her till (they were not in the first line!) straight from the back of the store, and she starts running them through. Before anyone asks no it was not some members only till or you had to have below 5 items till or something, it was a regular till. \n\nI'm pretty annoyed to see that she for absolutely no reason is sending us to the longer line while two more people just walk up and are getting rung through. I ask her why we have to wait in the long line while literally three more people just get to keep walking up no wait at all and just get through. And she just ignores me.\n\nYou'd think if you were to let anyone go through a shorter line you would let a 79 year old go through and not just some random fully able bodied people? \n\nSo I know this is not a big deal but it seems like a dick move to me that at least deserves a complaint to the store.\n\nmore info: my grandmother doesn't like others to use her card even me her granddaughter, I'm not going to invade her privacy. I told her I really didn't need two shirts but she wanted to do it anyways. The customers who came up afterwards were not workers since all workers had lanyards on with the logo of the store.

My job requires that I travel from time to time, so I have a friend, let's call her B, that has a copy of my keys, and comes to feed my cat and water my plants while I am away. A couple of weeks ago, I was away for 4 days, and B took care of my cat and plants, as usual.\n\nFast forward to yesterday morning: I am having a coffee with another friend (H), when she asks: \"hey, where did you buy your bedroom mirror? I was looking for something similar to it, but I cannot find it\". The thing is that I have never invited H to my home. Not for any reason in particular, I really like the girl, but it is a quite recent friendship, and I guess this never came up. So, I asked her how did she know I had a bedroom mirror, and she told me that B had taken her there for a whole afternoon while I was away. They were hanging out, sitting in my sofa and petting my cat.\n\nI was not happy about the whole thing, not because of H being in my home, but because of B bringing people to a place that it is not hers! I called B, and asked her for explanations. She admitted it right away, but when I voiced my discomfort with her taking liberties with my apartment, she got quite angry and yelled at me that \"I never specified\". Well, she is right, I did not explicitly say \"hey, you cannot bring other people into my home\" but I kind of assumed? When I told her this she called me TA, and told me that she was doing my a favour by feeding my cat and that \"beggars can't be choosers\". I just lost it at that point and hung up. We haven't talked after this, but H has told me that in addition to herself, B also took her parents during another trip I made in summer.\n\nI have talked about this with several people, some think that I am completely right on being angry while others (like H) think that I am overreacting and that it is not like she had thrown a party in my place. So, Reddit, I ask you, AITA?\n\nEDIT: \n\nI did not challenge B, I said I \"asked for explanations\", but I did not get angry at her, at first. I called and asked, in a calm voice, \"Hey, H is telling me that you brought her to my place while I was not there, how come you did not tell me?\", and then *she* snapped. TBH, B getting defensive right away was a confirmation that she knew she had done wrong.\n\nI do not pay her, she volunteered very enthusiastically when I mentioned that I could not find a catsitter for last Christmas. She loves my cat and she takes good care of him. I do not ask her to spend extra time with the cat other than to feed him, but she usually does it, she likes it, the cat likes it, everyone is happy. She has been told that she has free access to my pantry and fridge if she wants. I also house sit for her when she is travelling. We live two streets away, so it is convenient for both. \n\nI would not have minded at all that she brought people over if she had asked first, or even if she had mentioned it afterwards and not wait until I found out myself. I got pictures of the cat and questions/comments about the smallest things every day(\"he has drunk too much/too little water today, do you think he is okay?\"). Not complaining about that, just for context. I feel that my trust was betrayed because she left out the fact of having people over, while she was contacting me at all times for other things directly related to her being my cat sitter.\n        ",

When we all lived in Canada, I had 50/50 custody with my ex, until my now husband and I moved to a different province.  At that time, my ex wanted to go to school full time and we agreed that I would take our son full time, and his dad would see him as often as possible.  \n\nWe had him full time for three years, then his dad moved to the place we were living and we went back to 50/50 custody.  All totally amicable.\n\n5 years ago my husband got offered an amazing job in California.  I wanted my son to come down with us, but I felt super guilty about taking him away from his dad again so we talked about it and I told him that if he wanted to live with his dad, I understand.\n\nHe decided to stay with his dad.  TBH it sucks and I miss him every damn day.  \n\nWe send child support every 2 weeks, I text with him all the time, he comes to stay with us for 6 weeks every summer.  And we have always been super generous with gifts - we sent him $500 at Christmas.  And we are going to give him living expenses and help with the cost of his post secondary education.\n\nSo my son went and saw Shazam! on Friday afternoon.  We were going to see it Friday night.  He texted me and said \u201cHey the mom in the movie reminds me of you!\u201d\n\nOkay ... I watched the movie.  And saw the mother.  Who abandoned her kid.\n\nHoly shit.  I was in tears.  I texted him and told him how much that hurt me.  He said it was a joke.\n\nBut I don\u2019t feel like it was.\n\nI am so hurt that he would do that.  I would never ignore his birthday (which is in 4 days), but I\u2019m wondering if I should still send him the birthday money I was planning on, or if I should limit myself to a card and a phone call.\n\nI am too upset to figure out if that would be too bitchy.

We broke up because I wanted kids and he didn't (According to him). We agreed to not talk about our dating lives so that we could remain friends, but that fell apart pretty quickly.   \nI started seeing people and he started seeing people. We had a pretty amicable relationship.  \nHe started seeing someone that I knew of and at first I thought I was fine with it. I had also just been ghosted by the guy that I had been seeing, so I wasn't in the best place.  \n\n\nHe was set to travel to the states later this year for work but had some financial difficulties, I offered to give him 2 grand if he really needed it. \n\nI was having my 30th in a different state with family and I asked him if he could drive me (My car) to the airport, which he agreed. I get a call from him the following day saying that he couldn't, when I asked him why, he said that his current GF was insecure that he was still driving me places. In the same phone call, he also asked if the offer of the 2 grand was still on the table, I said it was. He said that it would really help him, but if i'm not happy to do it that he would totally understand. I said I would do it.

He works for the same company I work for, I created a position in the company specifically for him, which I told him I had made out of love which he no longer deserves and that if he cared about me at all that he would pull out of the position (He would no longer have a job there if he did).

We had a fairly decent sized wedding. My cousin (on my stepdads side - we are not close whatsoever) and her boyfriend have only been dating not even 6 months at this point. I\u2019ve met the guy once before my wedding and he never shows up to any family functions. We\u2019re all having a great time at my wedding. My husband and I are mingling with guest while everyone dances. \n\nThe next thing I know is my cousins boyfriend asks the DJ for his mike and goes to the center of the dance floor saying he has an \u201cannouncement\u201d to make and calls my cousin over. So, I rush over and say, \u201cNope, no one is getting engaged during my special day especially during my reception. You can get engaged later tonight but not right now. It\u2019s my day. Thank you for understanding.\u201d and I go to walk away. My cousin starts puffing and my aunt (her mom) starts yelling at me and calling me an entitled brat. It causes a huge fight and they all end up leaving. My mom, stepdad, dad, and stepmom all are on my side and were even pissed that they think its okay to do that during a wedding they all paid for. My nana (step dads mom) says I was wrong and told me to apologize and call them over and allow him to propose. Needless to say, it didn\u2019t happen. \n\nFlash forward to Christmas. Ugh, it was terrible! My stepdads entire side were rude and ignoring my husband and I. And of course, guess what happens! My cousin and her now fianc\u00e9 announced their wedding date - September 21st, 2020! \n\nI\u2019m beyond pissed and so not planning to go. It\u2019s my damn one year wedding anniversary! My family is upset that they would do that to piss me off for not allowing them to get engaged during my reception. My cousin says they chose to get married on their one year engagement anniversary.

        "input": "\n        scenario: WIBTA if I raised my roommates\u2019 rents by moving out early? | I rescued a kitten in October. My four roommates and I live in a carpeted house; they approved her before she came home. The downstairs carpet is disgusting and probably hasn\u2019t been cleaned properly in years. \n\nOne of my roommates, \u201cAlyssa\u201d, is severely allergic to cats. Another one, \u201cSadie\u201d, has some allergies. When I adopted my cat, I agreed to potentially rehome her if the allergies became an issue. I also agreed to vacuum every week and keep her in my room. \n\nAs my kitten got older, she decided that she didn\u2019t like being in the room all the time. For the sake of her mental stimulation, we started letting her out during the day with roommate approval. This was happening for about a month before winter break. \n\nSince break, Sadie has been increasingly hostile because of her \u201callergies\u201d, and has strongly implied that she wants us to rehome the cat or pay for her portion of the rent because of it being \u201cinhospitable\u201d for her. She claims that she can\u2019t breathe.\n\nFor context, I developed allergies around the age of 12, mostly to dust and cats. Dust is a 9/10 and cats are a 4/10. I grew up in an old house with cats and one slept in my room. Most nights I had to knock myself out with Benadryl because breathing was so hard. So, I get that allergies are awful and have been doing my part. \n\nThus far, we have:\n- been vacuuming regularly\n- looked for places for us/her to move to\n- put my $100 air purifier downstairs (which has helped significantly!)\n- offered to buy her allergy medicine\n- sent her a list of allergists who accept her insurance\n- limited cat\u2019s outside time to 2 hours a day max (with roommate approval and us monitoring)\n\nI can\u2019t say for sure, but from what I\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t think her allergies to the cat are that bad. It\u2019s not fair to blame it all on the cat given the state of the downstairs carpet. Alyssa has not been having bad reactions- it makes no sense. Also, if she\u2019d told me that her allergies were that bad in December, I would have either moved out or moved the cat back home for the semester. \n\nShe wants us to lock the cat in our room 24/7. It\u2019s reached the point where her entitled behavior is getting completely unbearable. She is 21 years old and acts like a child. Her parents pay for her rent, and she doesn\u2019t clean her own room- they drive six hours to visit her and do it for her.  \n\nLast fall, she had our landlord call a plumber because the drain wasn\u2019t working in our shower. Eventually I just snaked it and sent her a picture of what was obviously her hair. She immediately denied that it was hers and refused to take any of the blame. Needless to say, he dislikes her.\n\nWhen my partner approached the landlord, he gave us the option of moving out and shifting the rent for our room onto the rest of the household.\n\nI don\u2019t want to shaft my other roommates, but Sadie refuses to move, and Alyssa has been siding with her. It\u2019s all starting to take a toll on my mental health. \n\nSo, Reddit: WIBTA for moving out?\n        ",

She's a really good kid , so I rarely have to apologize for something she does or my bad parenting decisions. I often get compliments on how well behaved she is and her calm temperament, but make no mistake, she is still a toddler, so we have our moments.\n\nWe are at the checkout line and we are 2nd in line. They're two cashiers next to each other at a counter, so there is a lady in front of me (lady #1) and another lady in front of me (lady #2) , but off to the right a bit, maybe 2 feet away from us. My kid is acting up a little and trying to run off from me in the line, but no one has noticed us and no attention is being drawn. I grab her hand and she giggles a little loudly, as she thinks it's funny, then drops her toy she had in her hand. She gets down to retrieve it, but when she gets up she is very close to lady #2, and in that split second she thought she was me and hugs her legs from behind, her head landing between her legs, right under her butt.\n\nI quickly called out my daughter's name to help her realize,Whoa, that ain't mommy. The look on her face when she realized that she was hugging a stranger was priceless and a funny  honest mistake. I'm laughing and herding my daughter back over to me. this lady turns around and she is pissed. She was about 25 and she was giving my daughter a look as if she was a 40 year old slimeball who just grabbed her ass. \n\nI get not all people like kids and I respect that, but I thought she was going to hit my kid with the look she had on her face. She continued to stay turned staring at my daughter with a scowl of hatred. Now I'm already laughing, but I'm a nervous laugher on top it. So when I see this lady acting like she is about to unwind on my kid, the laughing just continues. The lady then glares at me and I cant help myself.. I keep laughing, but I glared right back. I said nothing. Normally I'm a pushover and very easy and quick to apologize for anything and everything, but the fact that she seemed so offended by a kid accidently hugging her, it almost wanted to make me see red. I hugged my daughter and then looked up at this woman who had the most ugly twisted face at this point and I just smiled and raised my eyebrows as to ask if there was a problem here.\n\nThis whole thing lasted maybe 15 seconds, but fuck that time lasted forever. Lady #1then turns around and is now just staring at me and my daughter as well, shaking her head a bit in disapproval. That gets me thinking, wow, did I just make a parenting fuck up that I should have apologized for instead of laughing at this woman and her reaction? So was I the asshole in all of this?\n\nNormally i would apologize at the drop of a hat, but the way this lady looked at my daughter with such hatred really just pissed me off badly. What do you guys think? Did mama bear mode get the best of me? I kinda fear I'm the asshole\n\n\nEdit: I'm the asshole. I could and should have easily diffused the situation with a quick apology for my daughter's accidental hug, but I just laughed in a way that could be taken very offensively. That's where I fucked up and should have shut up . To the random lady in the store, if your reading this, I'm sorry! My daughter thought you were me.\n\nIf you guys want to read about me and my many more fuck ups with my 6 other kids, look for me on Entitled Parents.

We're minding our own business and them theres. Suddenly one of the parents comes over to the bench where we're sitting and throws out a diaper in the garage can near where I'm sitting, a couple feet away.

All I do is interrupt what I had been saying to my friend and say \"Thats disgusting are you kidding me?\". Didnt expect anyone to care.\n\n\nSuddenly the parent stops and says \"sorry were you talking to me?\" I didn't want to get into it but literally seeing a shitty diaper thrown out just a few feet from my head and sandwich made my lunch feel rotten in my mouth so I said casually \"I just think you didn't need to throw out a shitty diaper right next to my head\". The parent rolls their eyes and said \"it wasnt even poop so you'll be okay\". I say that's not true because I can smell shit but theyre already walking away shaking their head and I can see them go sit back with the other parent and obviously tells them what happened because I see them look over with an audible \"seriously dude?\" now everyone is looking at me and my friends are telling me to drop it. I say I guess no one cares that my lunch is ruined because we're all siding with the parents here.\n\n\nThe parents dont say anything else to me and my friends tell me to drop it but I'm pissed that my lunch is ruined so I throw the rest of it out. \n\nI might be the asshole here. As we leave I was still mad so when we pass the park I say something like \"I guess we all have to cater to people with babies now\". One of the parents goes \"seriously?\" again as we pass and my friend apologies to them and tells me to drop it. I don't say anything else.\n\n\nMy side is that I should be able to eat my lunch in public without someone tossing out shit right beside me. Families have the right to public spaces too but so do regular people. They could have just as easily bagged the diaper up and thrown it out in a bathroom or somewhere more appropriate. \n\n\nI made a joke about it as we go to lunch today that hopefully I can eat this time without shit sitting next to me and my friend told me again that I need to get over it and that they said it wasnt even poop but I'm not going to sift through the garbage to find it and prove myself right. I believe I'm in the right to expect some courtesy in a public space but my friends told me to shut up about it.

I told my gf that I was going to make a profile, the first line of my bio says that I'm in a monogamous relationship, and I told her I would include a photo of us together if she was comfortable with that. (I also said I would let her look through it wherever she wanted).\n\nOriginally, she said this was fine and told me to send her funny quotes from the profiles. She said she trusted me and knew I was not looking to cheat. However, she has backtracked and now says she's uncomfortable but doesn't want to control me. \n\nI don't want to upset her, but I have a lot of fun looking at these profiles and don't think I'm doing anything wrong. To me, this is no different then going to a bar or club without my gf; sure I could meet someone but that's not what I'm there for, I'm there for entertainment. My gf and I have talked about being okay with each other dancing with other girls, and going out and understand we might be hit on,  we don't see that as cheating.  But if you trust me to be drinking and dancing with girls why don't you feel comfortable with this app?\n\nEDIT for clarity: I appreciate the input and will be talking to her tonight about it and most likely deleting the app, just wanted to add some clarity to why I was confused by the situation:\n\n1. I remade an account this morning and was only on the app for about 15 minutes before work. \n\n2. I had no matches and only had the app for a few hours before she texted a large paragraph about how she originally said it was fine but now felt uncomfortable. I didn't write this because I was ignoring her feelings, I was confused because in my eyes nothing had changed since I only had the app on my phone for a short time\n\n3. The part about going to clubs/bars was added because she enjoys partying and dancing with other girls, I'm more of a home body but when I go out I dance with my friends and sometimes people who join the group. We both discussed the etiquette for going out- what was okay and what was cheating- and both are fine with dancing and flirting. My point was, why is dancing with girls okay but having a tinder profile not?\n\n4. I reached out to talk more in depth but since we both work and can't speak until tonight I wanted input from y'all. I know I need to get better at seeing things from different perspectives and I understand now why the app makes people uncomfortable, I'm just still confused about why the app is considered cheating but clubbing isn't (per our previous convos)\n\nEither way I accept that I'm TA and will apologize to her\n        ",

Recently I was diagnosed with a very rare form of brain cancer and while we caught it early enough doctors believe I\u2019m a high risk for relapse in the future. Essentially I have been given 15 years max to live. Recently I held a WIG party where my hardiresser and close friends brought in wigs and shaved my head. This is where the problem starts. Kat has been sucked into one of those essential oil MLM\u2019s and has become somewhat of a soul sucking banshee but despite all that she\u2019s been supportive of me in the past and she\u2019s still my best friend. I\u2019ve dealt with her saying her oils could do better for me than chemo and telling me I\u2019m just killing myself faster by not using her oils so I\u2019ve been close to my breaking point for awhile. I finally broke when Kat showed up without a wig or food but with a huge poster board of her MLM along with some of the products she sells. I of course started sobbing and all of our friends ripped Kat a new one. Kat has sent me some pretty nasty emails saying I\u2019m not supportive and her mom has called my mom to scream about how ungrateful I am. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my emotions being out of sorts or the anxiety of everything going on but I feel like a huge asshole. \n\n\n\n\n**EDIT** I\u2019ve decided to have a sit down with Kat along with four of our mutual friends. I plan on telling her she\u2019s out of line with her MLM stuff and that I\u2019ve tried to be supportive of it but I can\u2019t any longer. My friends and I are essentially planning an intervention. In the future if or when she apologizes I may consider recconecting but right now I\u2019m too hurt to even look at her. My mother also lost a friend today (Kats mother) over the whole debacle and we\u2019re both very very emotionally exhausted. Thank you for the kind responses and I\u2019ll try to respond to each and everyone of you later today or tomorrow.\n        ",

One thing she does is, after washing, put cutlery back in the drawer without care e.g. fork in the knife area, knife in the little spoon area, etc. Every time I noticed this, I'd fix it and then ask her to put the cutlery in the correct area next time. That didn't occur. She sees it as nagging and told me it \"wasn't a big deal.\" I generally reply that being neat is a good habit. For context, I think I'm a somewhat neat person e.g. white pegboard, labelled and shelved garage, dividers in the sock drawer, filing cabinet for important documents and receipts, everything has a place and everything in it's place. She has a folder of all her documents that looks like the wallet of George Costanza.\n\nAnyway, since she moved in some of our things have mixed together with messy results. Her very meagre cutlery set (10ish pieces) is one example. She has her preferred utensils and I use whatever's in the drawer. Having preferred utensils in a mixed scenario generally benefits from nice organisation. However, about 2 weeks ago I got a bit fed up and asked her to please pay attention where to put the cutlery back. Again, I got told \"not a big deal, back off\" so I then asked if it would be a big deal if I removed the dividers entirely. I got a \"do whatever you want\" reply. That was tacit approval in my book.\n\nTime for cutlery anarchy baby! I moved the divider into a labelled box in the garage. Since then she struggles to find her *special* forks and spoons in this metal utensil jungle. The result is now I'm getting blamed for this disorganised cutlery chaos to which I'm responding \"it's not a big deal\".\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nGirlfriend put cutlery into the drawer chaotically. I nag. She says \"no big deal\" and doesn't change her ways. After tacit approval, I remove any divisions of cutlery in the drawer. Cutlery is in chaos.

She replied \"Sure\".\nWe were going to spend the entire day and night together.\n\nWhen i arrived at her house she asked me why i asked for a later time and i told her the truth not thinking much of it.\nShe got quite pissed at me because she interpeted this as me \"not valueing her that much to prefer my videogames over her\".\n\nShe did calm down during the day but i still was convinced she overreacted. When i tried to converse over this subject a couple hours later she reacted pissed and told me \"if you would ask any of my female friends what they would think of it if their date told them they would be late by an hour they would all react like 'that guy isn't well enough interested in you, next!' \". I dropped the subject and so did she afterwards.\n\nTo be fair i do see her point but she immediatly assumes that i did that because i'm not interested, which i am.. \nBut then again i'm also really really clueless when it comes to dating so maybe this is a much bigger deal to women then i as a clueless man might think?\n\n1.

So they've been gathering interest this whole time.\n\nThe reason why we're friends is we met at an anime convention when I was on vacation in the US. Well recently, she messaged me saying she's moving to Canada because she hates the US, and she believed her life would be easier once she moved to Canada. And asked me for my opinion and advice.\n\nAnd well, I told her that would not be a wise idea. 1. The immigration process is incredibly difficult. 2. She's not stable financially, and moving here isn't going to help that, especially with adjusting to a new tax system, new education system, new income system, as well as different living arrangements. 3. She still has over 20,000 in student loans to pay off and to clear up some misconceptions, no we do not clear student loans if you move here.\n\nThe truth is you can move here easily, BUT settling down and going through the entire process of being a citizen is incredibly difficult. \n\nNow, I didn't say 'Screw you, we don't want you.' I said this.\n\n'Look, i'm happy you like my country, but to be honest, that may not be the best choice for you, you might want to take the time and research the process, and then decide if its what you really want. Or if you're desperate ot move, maybe consider moving somewhere else in the states that isn't detroit.'\n\n\nShe starts screaming at me over messenger asking me why I'm being such a bitch about it, and honestly I don't get it, was I not polite about it? \n\nI wasn't telling her to stay out, I was simply asking her to think it through completely, I've seen too many people who moved here from the US thinking its some kind of paradise but then couldn't make it here and moved back. And I don't want that to happen to a friend.\n\nEDIT: The reason being I think she didn't research it is 1. She was asking me for info about Canada and 2. Because she said she only decided to immigrate because she heard the stereotypes about canadians being genuinanlly nice people (Okay, yes we can be polite, but we have assholes like everyone else.\n\nShe also told me herself that she didn't imagine the immigration process would be difficult because of how she claimed it couldn't be harder than someone trying to become a US citizen.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not constantly reassuring my friend after she miscarried? | Throwaway\nLet me preface this with saying my best friend (G) and I have always had a weird relationship. G is 20F and I\u2019m 21M. We go periods of time without seeing each other but we always meet right where we left off. We go through bouts of dating, being fwb and then dating again. There\u2019s never been any resentment, there\u2019s actually lots of love there, but I do feel like she\u2019s invested more emotionally than I am. \n\nOne day right after I dropped her off G messaged me that she needed to talk to me, this made me really anxious. When we met up G told me she miscarried what would have been our child. G said she was sorry for springing this on me and had no one else she could talk to about it, her family is very strict, her religious mother still believes she\u2019s a virgin. G said she was gathering the courage to tell me about the pregnancy and then she ended up miscarrying. \n\nI\u2019m going to admit I\u2019m not the the most emotional person, G moved away after high school, I had a whole different relationship for about a year and a half, broke it off around the same time G decided to move back. I didn\u2019t really feel upset. I just thought what\u2019s done is done. I went through a similar reaction, told her I was glad she told me, that I hope she\u2019s okay mentally, physically etc. G told me she hopes this doesn\u2019t change anything between us and I told her not to worry. Left it at that, I dropped her off at home. \nI replayed our conversation in my head and started to freak myself out, I decided to focus on my work and in doing so weeks went by without us speaking. I figured if G wanted to talk to me she would. A couple more weeks go by, I was at work and received a text from G our convo went like this\n\nG: Hey, I know you said I have nothing to be sorry about but i am, like I really can\u2019t help but feel like all I did was add stress to you and logically I know that\u2019s the part of me that overthinks and idk I\u2019m just really afraid of losing you and I know that I needed you to know this but I was really scared this would be the turning point of you never wanting to talk to me or see me again\n\nMe: listen if you\u2019re good, I\u2019m good. Don\u2019t be sorry\n\nG: I really don\u2019t think you understood what I was saying or only half of it at least\n\nI was over it, didn\u2019t respond, it\u2019s been a few more weeks and after attending one of my shows she texted me saying about how talented I am. I didn\u2019t respond, I believe she needs time away from me. Our mutual friend has been wondering why we haven\u2019t been hanging out, I explained the situation and he stared in disbelief afterwards, called me an \u201cemotionally constipated dickhead\u201d and said I should reach out to her to reassure her. I care about her but we handle our emotions so differently I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be any help.\n\nTLDR; got my friend pregnant, she miscarried. I tried to comfort her but her constant worrying pushed me further into my work and now my friends are calling me a dick for not reaching out.\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: thanks everybody, I clearly am the asshole and need to do some deep thinking and reevaluate my friendship.

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for changing my daughter\u2019s visitation schedule once? | I had my first child, Jessica, with my ex-wife when I was just 20 years old. We divorced, and I let my ex-wife take full custody and move into the neighboring state (I regret this now but lacked resources to fight). I visited when I could and when Jessica was old enough she would come to visit for her summer breaks.\n\nEventually I met my current wife, a wonderful woman who had no problems at all with Jessica visiting. We fell in love and we even had Jessica fly in to be the flower girl at our wedding. She was very happy for us and all was well.\n\nMy wife fell pregnant soon after and we realized that her due date would fall in July, right in the middle of Jessica\u2019s usual visitation. We contacted my ex wife and explained that my wife would be due during the visit and we would not be able to care for Jessica, but she would be welcome to visit for Spring Break.\n\nMy ex exploded (we were fairly civil before this) and demanded that we make accommodations, like having my brother and his wife take in Jessica while my wife labored. I explained that labor wasn\u2019t the only concern, because my wife would be dealing with hormones and learning to be a mom, and I would have to return to work quickly so it would be all on my wife.\n\nWhen Jessica visited next, she asked me why she couldn\u2019t visit before, and if I would send away her baby sister when I eventually have a second. I told her that we did the best we could.\n\nThe next year my ex wife told me that Jessica wanted to stay home to focus on her studies. She never came back for another summer, instead visiting briefly around the holidays, and not even every year. She has been much colder, and I think my ex has had a large role in that.\n\nIn my mind we were simply being realistic. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair to Jessica to be here in the chaos of a new baby, and it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to my wife to make her care for a child that wasn\u2019t hers when she was so vulnerable. In literally all other cases she treated Jessica like one of her own. Likewise, at the time my brother was a flake, so leaving her with them was not an option.\n\nI ask this now because Jessica just turned 18. I called her up and asked if we could put the past behind us and begin again, as adults. She said she had no interest in making a relationship with someone who wasn\u2019t even family to her.\n\nI told her she was malicious and that she has chosen to hold a grudge for years. I said I would never be able to be worthy to her, and that I was done going through that pain. If she wanted a relationship I would be there, but I wouldn\u2019t force it.\n\nMy brother says that I\u2019m being a jerk and that Jessica\u2019s in pain\u2014 and I get that, I really do, but she is the one who has chosen not to move past it.

We have been married for 3 years now and get along really great. \n\nHowever she is an incredibly intense personality and when she gets something on her brain, she almost is stymied from doing or thinking about anything else. Right now she wants to start looking at buying a house. She must look at Zillow and various real estate websites 100 time a day and she is constantly looking at houses and she's always sticking her phone in my face saying \"I love this one so much\" and then want to have an in depth conversation about everything form how we'll afford it to how she wants to decorate it. \n\nThe reality is unless we absolutely stretch, we can't afford a house for a few more years so to me, it's not the urgent rush that she's making it. \n\nI had a terrible day at work yesterday. I had to fire a really nice guy who really needed the job but had just screwed up way too many times. It really ate at me all day long and I wanted to get home, eat a frozen burrito over the sink and then put my headphones on and rock out to bad 80/90s pop music. \n\nAs soon as I stepped through the door my wife shoved her phone in my face and started going on and on about how she found the perfect house in the historic district she loved and she'd talked to the agent and we needed to start getting our financing together (say that at the speed of a cracked out chipmunk trying to get laid and add a thousand more words and you can sort of see how she was acting). I told her I'd had a really bad day and just didn't have the brain power to process anything that wasn't realistically going to happen. \n\nI went to heat up my burrito and she just kept pestering me. I told her several times that I just needed a break. She kept at me so I finally told her I couldn't talk about this tonight and please leave me along. She just kept at it but started mixing in things about how I'm ruining her dreams and the real estate agent told her that if we didn't act today this house was going to be gone. She just wouldn't listen to me so I picked up the spray bottle (full of water) we use to squirt the cats and sprayed her right in the face. \n\nShe got understandably pissed and hasn't spoken to me. At first I felt like I'd done the right thing because I got a little breathing room. But she is still not speaking to me and while she slept next to me I could feel her moving around all night and huffing and puffing like she was really mad. \n\nWas I the asshole for what I did?\n\n(caveat that we have sprayed each other with that same bottle many times but always playfully).\n        ",

It's a tradition for us. At the production last night (nutcracker) there was a small family seated next to us. The hall in which the event took place wasn't very well heated and because of recent terrorist threats no coats or bags were allowed inside. \n\nSo we all sit in the freezing hall and the family gets next to us. They consist of a mother, father, older kid daughter and a very, very sick baby. The baby was so young that it didn't even have its own seat, it was always handled from parent to parent during the play. \n\nAnyways: during the whole first act the child cried and cried and coughed without pause. Moreso: once the rat king in his terrifying costume showed up he got really upset and started screaming. The mother did not leave the hall with him but instead calmed him down (very loudly), earning a lot of annoyed looks from the other guests. The whole first act was ruined for us because the baby's cries prevented us from enjoying the production. Once the break between first and second act started and the lights came back on I could see that the child's face was red and glowing and the hair on his head was so sweaty, it got stuck on his forehead, meaning the child definitely had a fever as the hall was freezing as mentioned before. I got over to the mother and asked her to leave the production since her child was obviously sick and upset and did not enjoy the ballet, which caused half of the hall to not enjoy the ballet either.\n\nShe got very very angry with me, saying that I should not question her parenting if I wasn't a parent myself and that it was none of my business how she took care of her child. The father came over and scolded me as well, saying that I was rude for constantly giving them dirty looks during the production. A third, not related older woman also told me that I had no right to ask them to leave since they payed their tickets just like I did. \n\nI once again told them that a sweating, coughing baby does not belong into a freezing hall but should instead go lie down in a bed and that it was rude to the dancers to have the attention taken away from them because half the hall had to be annoyed by their crying coughing child.\n\nThe second act was just like the first with the exception that the child got very upset again and did not want to sit still anymore. The father then actually did decide to take him home. The mother touched my shoulder and very loudly and very rudely asked me if I was happy now and that I had ruined their first ballet production as a family.\n\nAITA for wanting to enjoy a family tradition that we payed a lot of money for in peace??

She started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. Everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.\n\nThen one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, \"Do you seriously fucking think that I *actually like* eating at Olive Garden?\"\n\nGuys, she saw the post. She was *furious*. \n\nShe doesn't like Olive Garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap.

You don't know me at all.\"\n\nShe yelled about Olive Garden for a solid twenty minutes. It wasn't just about Olive Garden, but it was a lot about Olive Garden.\n\nLong story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. She \"loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage\" from me for her own personal betterment.\n\n So, yeah.\n\nTL;DR: I ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. I didn't take her out on dates and I didn't pay enough attention. I would do anything to fix everything.\n\nEdit: To clarify a few things\n\n1. I didn't post on April First.\n\n2. I say that she yelled about \"mostly Olive Garden\" because she did. She was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over Olive Garden, where the kids are catered to.\n\n3. She did not call herself Latino.

So since MIL and FIL really wanted to spend time with SIL and her daughter (MIL and FIL\u2019s granddaughter) and SIL basically gave the last minute ultimatum they decided to lock the cat out of the house for the duration of their stay. \n\nNow, I understand BIL has an allergy, and allergies suck. But no one even called us to ask if the cat would be okay stuck outside for days at a time. We were perfectly reachable by phone but they just decided to put him outside and we found out when we came back and got a message to not let the cat inside and he has to stay outside. If we had known I could have gotten my dad to take the cat because he also lives in the same town. There is also other family that do not have cats that BIL and SIL could have arranged to stay with.\n\nSo, AITA for being pretty upset at my MIL and FIL for forcing my cat outside for almost a week? AITA for also being upset that SIL and BIL expected them to get rid of him to accommodate their visit?\n\nEdit: I think I may have been unfair to my MIL and FIL here. They love our cat very much and take very good care of him. They were in a hard spot and I think made the wrong decision in not calling us. While he was outside my MIL checked on him and petted him everyday and made sure he stayed around. I think no one really thought the visit through enough until the last minute and I was upset that SIL and BIL were okay with them putting the cat out so they could visit. They are all really wonderful people and this is not going to be a relationship ender. MIL and FIL have now apologized for not calling us when this came up.\n        ",

She lives in a retirement home and has dementia but is otherwise doesn\u2019t really have any serious health conditions. Her children are pretty busy and are only able to see her about once a week, so they essentially pay me to be her friend.\n\n   When I started doing this, she was pretty aware of what was happening, but nowadays she is mostly confused and can only hold a conversation for about a minute max. This lady has told me a lot about her life, and she has been a very dedicated vegetarian for around 20 years. She told me a story about how she accidentally ate meat about 10 years ago and how she was devastated when she found out. \n\n   Now that her dementia has gotten worse, she can\u2019t really read so most of the time I order for her. We go to one restaurant fairly often because I know she likes the vegetarian options that they have there. The past few times I\u2019ve taken her out, she\u2019ll say that she wants to get a hamburger or steak. When I remind her that she\u2019s been vegetarian for a very long time, she will immediately forget about the meat and ask me to get her something vegetarian. \n\nHowever today after I reminded her she was vegetarian after she asked for a hamburger, she told me that she wasn\u2019t ever vegetarian and she didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. She kept insisting that she wanted a hamburger but I didn\u2019t want to upset her if she realized what she had gotten. I ended up ordering her what she usually gets and when it came out she was happy about it and forgot about wanting a hamburger. I kinda felt bad about not getting her what she wanted, but I knew that if she remembered she was vegetarian when the food came out she would be very upset. \n\n   I told my sister about this, and she told me I was being TA for not getting her the burger that she wanted. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t want to upset her in case she remembered,but my sister told me that it didn\u2019t matter because she should be able to choose what she wants to eat. If she had realized that she had even ordered something with meat on it, she would be very upset, and I doubt meat would be digestible after not eating it for 20 years anyways. So what should I do? WIBTA if I don\u2019t let her get meat next time she asks? Or should I stick to her diet that she has followed for so long?\n        ",

Shortly afterwards, a friend of mine got me a cactus to help me feel better, which was also in coincidence with my cactus dying. Anyone that knows me knows that I love cactuses too. Not too long after that, another friend of mine also got me a cactus. Here I was, moved by my friends with my two cacti while I mourned my cat. \n\n\nSkip to yesterday and I get a text from my older sister: \"I broke your cactus, sorry.\" I called her and asked her what happened, to which she replied: \"You put them in a bad place, and I bumped into one. It broke, so I threw it away.\"\n\n\nI thought she meant she threw the pot away, considering both my cacti are less than 3 inches tall and wouldn't be terribly bothered by a short fall. Turns out, she threw the cactus itself away. I wasn't home at the time and I didn't want to argue over the phone so I remained calm and asked her why she threw it away. She thought it wouldn't survive. I was a bad mix of heartbroken and pissed off inside. Both of my cacti mean a lot to me. Not only do they remind me of my cat, but they remind me that people outside my family do care about me; these gifts were probably the most thoughtful I've ever been given, especially in a time where I felt extremely insignificant.\n\n\nLuckily she only threw them in the kitchen garbage, not the outside bin. When I got home, I dug Barnaby out of the garbage and put him in a new pot. I didn't ask my sister to dig him out because I knew she wouldn't.

When my sister got home today, I vented to her that I was hurt how little she cared for something that she knew was of great importance to me.

I tried to explain again multiple times to help her understand my frustration but she became more agitated every time until she told me she \"never wanted to hear the word cactus again\" and that I was attacking her.

She said I was only mad because a couple weeks ago I asked her to take out the recycling for me because I'd forgotten and it was Sunday night, and I'd taken out the trash for her earlier that day before I left.

After I said happy birthday, she told me she got the gift and the card we had sent her the week before. This is probably where I fucked up, because I had no idea that we had sent her a card, let alone multiple, thinking that my wife took initiative because she personally loves getting cards. I read the card and noticed that at the bottom, she'd signed the card \"Wife, child 1, child 2, child 3, my name\". Typically, the husband/boyfriend's comes first, then the wife/girlfriend's name comes before all of their kids' names, I wouldn't even mind being second after my wife instead of first on the card. It rubbed me the wrong way that she'd purposely put my name after my kids. Then, I noticed she'd done that with every single card she had sent on our behalf (my mother has them on display) for the past few years and I can only assume she does it too when she sends cards to other family members too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked her about it when we were at home, and she didn't see anything wrong with it, saying that if I wanted my name first, then I should write the cards to my family.

She initially kept me in the loop about wedding planning, and it was always insinuated (so I assumed), that I would be asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nShe decided on a very small ceremony, which she then told me would only include parents and one of her childhood friends as a witness/bridesmaid. I was totally fine with this, because I get that it's her wedding. She is planning a reception for all other family and friends to attend a few days later.\n\nAs planning continued, she asked me for dates I was free to go with her to wedding dress shop. My schedule is fairly fixed so I sent her my schedule for the next few months. She told me she was planning for a certain weekend when I was off, and then I heard nothing from her. As that day got closer I messaged her and asked about it and she replied \"oh we already went and got a dress\". Honestly, my feelings were a little bruised. I heard less and less about wedding planning as time went on.\n\nNow, all of this would be fine. And it's all kind of background to my AITA question. I 100% understand that it's her wedding, her day, and she can do whatever she likes and include whoever she wants. But here's my issue: she wants an expensive shower/bachelorette weekend that includes a spa day, wine tasting, high tea, etc.... And this other friend/sole bridesmaid has asked me if I would be willing to split the cost with her. It's going to cost a lot in addition to all the other costs from just attending (travel, hotel, gift, etc).\n\nI have a great job and could afford to help (her childhood friend is currently in med school and is very financially stressed).... But AITA if I don't think it's fair I'm being asked to contribute a big chunk of cash to this bachelorette weekend when I'm not even a bridesmaid and haven't been included in really any aspect? I haven't given an answer yet, but don't really know what to do here.\n\nEDIT to add/clarify: I am not invited to the ceremony. I am invited to the reception.

Yes it was true but I was just joking.

We have 2 wonderful children that we love dearly. She had to have a c-section because reasons and they were going to do a tubal at the same time. I had read some not so good stories about those and told her I would get fixed.  She agreed to leave herself intact and I would get a vasectomy.\n\nShe can't take birth control because of some blood thing and she suffers from depression. We were married for 9 years playing russian roulette before getting pregnant with our first child. We presently use condoms. Not our favorite, but she won't take any chance on getting pregnant again.\n\nAfter our son turned a year old, she reminded me of that promise. I sorta brushed her off and honestly forgot about it.

I'm a little terrified of possible adverse effects. \n\nRecently we've had some issues (mostly my fault) and she said she wishes I would get fixed because if we divorce she doesn't want to deal with potential half siblings. (I don't think we're divorce level yet and I am working on the things she's unhappy with).\n\nShe also recently found out she needs an ablation with tubal to resolve some issues she's been having. I thought this solved both our problems and told her as such. I, apparently, was wrong and am an asshole that should follow through with my promise. I told her I didn't see the point now since she is basically where we were from the beginning before I even offered. So AITA because I changed my mind or should she accept that now since she will be getting fixed and there's no need for me to?\n\nEdited to add a shameful part I didn't think was necessary to the story, but explains a bit: \n\nShe brought up the half sibling because she found out about a ONS years ago and it occurred to her that I wouldn't have used a condom.

It was very emotional and we went to bed to rest. \n\nThe next morning his cousin announced in a family group chat that she gave birth to her second child and this was literally seconds from us announcing our engagement. I was, of course, ecstatic but I didn't want to steal her thunder and my fianc\u00e9 and I decided we wouldn't announce it as I wouldn't want someone to do that to me if the roles were reversed. Also, I don't know if it is worth noting it but she was due in a couple of weeks and this engagement was a complete surprise.\n\nWe told all of our immediate friends and family yesterday (Thursday the 6th) and told them to refrain from telling anyone about it until we officially announce. I'm just so happy about it and I obviously want to tell everyone about it. My fianc\u00e9 agrees with me and wants to announce it ASAP but my fear is that IWBTA if I announce it today.\n\nSo, Reddit, what's the verdict?

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for telling my moms friend to shut up and stop telling me how I will die? | So I am fourteen, and i was diagnosed with type one diabetes when I was eleven. A lot of people don\u2019t realize how serious of a disease it is, until you or a loved one has been affected by it. Generally, I am completely independent with taking shots, pricking my finger, but I do have slip ups, and my family understands, as this is a tough disease and a lot of responsibility that popped up out of nowhere for a kid. \nThroughout my daily life I deal with a lot of dumbasses who are uneducated, but that\u2019s a part of normal life too. My mom has a friend who had a husband that died due to complications with the disease. Let\u2019s call her Nancy. Nancy likes to try to \u201ceducate\u201d me on my own disease. \n\nJust a little background, you basically never fully understand the disease until you yourself has it. And the disease is fairly unique to each individual, how your blood sugar reacts to certain foods, how it changes over time, etc.\nEverytime she comes over she likes to try to \u201cscare me with facts\u201d by telling me how I\u2019m not responsible enough , and how her husband died from the disease and how it\u2019s going to happen to me and whatnot if I don\u2019t shape up. I get that you may not want that to happen to somebody else, but I\u2019m still a fucking kid, I have basically realized after so many horrible visits to the hospital, that I will probably die from this disease, an already morbid realization for a kid. \n\nSo last night, she came over, and I was eating a chocolate bar. My mom asked me if I tested my blood sugar, I said no and rushed to get that done, sometimes I forget, but no damage has been done yet. I come back and report my nice blood sugar, and I am about to leave the room when Nancy says\u201d if you keep messing up like that, you are going to end up like my last husband, who died from the disease and...\u201d I roll my eyes as she as said this SO.MANY.TIMES. I am fed up, I shoot a mean look and reply \u201cWell Nancy I sure am glad you are here! Why don\u2019t you shut your mouth and let me figure out this disease for myself? And please shut up about the whole dying crap, ok?\u201d I run to my room on the verge of tears, because I can\u2019t believe what I just did and I am freaking tired of hearing this. Later, my mom tells me she wants me to apologize to Nancy. \nWhile I do understand I probably should\u2019ve ignored her, I don\u2019t think telling a kid how he is going to die repeatedly is ok, especially for an adult who is older than forty. I am starting to think I was too rude and I may be the asshole here.What do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: for those of you saying my mom is in the wrong here too, I totally understand. But I\u2019m pretty sure my mom is one of Nancy\u2019s closest friend, kinda like an emotional support human. So while my mom understands why I\u2019m mad, she understands Nancy more than most people, and I assume Nancy has some unknown problems. And this is a unique situation, my mom fought the entire county school board just so I can stay at my school, check my levels during tests, and more. So while my mom may look like a neglectful cunt, just give her the benefit of the doubt, ok?\n\nDOUBLE EDIT: I cannot express how much I appreciate those who have cheered me up and helped me feel better in the comments, saying you believe in me, how it gets better, etc. and to my fellow diabetics who have came together and told me how this disease doesn\u2019t have to control me, thanks so much to you too! And to those who have messaged me, sending me thoughtful, and very kind words, thanks soo much! I am feeling much more down to earth and have been thinking with my head, and not my emotions, thanks to everybody! Just wanted to express my gratitude\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for bringing my own meal to a family gathering? | My cousin\u2019s wife (25F), Jazz, is a vegetarian (going vegan, but she is having a hard time giving up eggs lol). I (21F) am an avid meat-lover; however, I really like vegan and vegetarian food, so I often go out to eat with Jazz. I also spend a lot of time with her in general, so I was going to have to get used to it whether I wanted to or not.\n\nBecause she\u2019s vegetarian, she usually brings her own food to family get-togethers. Her husband (who usually cooks) is pretty accommodating when we\u2019re at his parents\u2019 house. He\u2019ll usually bring ingredients for a dish to cook for her, rather than have her bring something pre-made or purchased.\n\nHowever, our other family members are less accommodating. Culturally, we\u2019re known to eat a LOT of meat. It\u2019s in pretty much every dish, so she definitely has to bring something in that case.\n\nWe recently were on our way to a different family member\u2019s house, so we stopped to pick up food for her. The restaurant had meat and vegan options. When we entered, there was a large sign for a delicious-looking, non-vegan dish. Since Jazz was already ordering something, I decided to get the dish.\n\nFast forward to us arriving at my family member\u2019s house. They expected Jazz to come with a meal, but were surprised to see that I had one too.\n\nThey had cooked for everyone, but Jazz and I came late because of her work schedule and a prior commitment of mine. No one other than Jazz and I were going to be eating at that time, so I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal to bring my own meal. Also, they\u2019re notorious for making a specific meal that I just really don\u2019t like.\n\nAs soon as they found out I had brought my own meal, they hit me with the evil eye. I could tell they were really upset while I was eating, but I didn\u2019t know how to rectify the situation. They had indeed made the dish that I really dislike, so it wasn\u2019t as though I could eat some of that with the meal I brought.\n\nThe night ended with my other cousin telling me that it was extremely rude for me to bring my own meal. I mentioned how Jazz had brought her own meal because she didn\u2019t eat what they made and how I\u2019ve made it clear that I\u2019m not a big fan of the dish they had made, so it made sense that I brought my own.\n\nThey said it was different because Jazz did it from a \u201cmoral\u201d stand-point not because she was picky. Jazz only switched to vegetarian because meat hurt her stomach, and she has only begun to switch to vegan because she\u2019s lactose intolerant anyway. She did not do this for her \u201cmorals.\u201d\n\nMy cousin still holds that it\u2019s a whole different thing and has pretty much said not to bring my own meal to her house ever again.\n\nSo AITA for bringing my own meal to a family get-together?\n\nEdit 1: I probably should make it clear that I dislike the dish they make because it makes me sick. I\u2019m not \u201callergic\u201d to tomatoes, but they make my stomach upset, and I end up in the bathroom for the rest of the night.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this to them before, but they only make THAT dish, so I figured I\u2019d bring my own meal. If I was to go earlier when everyone was eating, I would\u2019ve considered making a dish for everyone, but everyone had already eaten by then.\n        ",

Since then she has been staying here, and its just been unbelievably frustrating. She nags and berates me over everything. The food I eat is too unhealthy, I play too many video games, I work too many hours, the friends I have are too rowdy, she tells me like five times a day that I drink too much and that smoking weed is going to kill me, she complains constantly about any girl that I bring over to the point of actively insulting them, she is constantly trying to get me to pray or go to church with her... its not like I am living some insanely hedonistic lifestyle lol. I drink with friends maybe once a week and I smoke pot on the roof with my friends occasionally too, but to her I might as well as spiraling out of control into addiction or something. I went to a party and came home at like 4am, and she was literally awake waiting for me, saying she was worried sick and that 4am is far too late to come home. One time she started literally crying... because she was sad at the sight of me playing video games for 3 hours. She thought it was 'depressing' to see me be so unproductive.

I've lived almost my entire life with my mom and my brother. I've always been picky with food ever since I was little. \n\nA year ago my mom got a new boyfriend and pretty quickly he moved into the house. He's a big fan of food and likes to experiment with it. He cooks for us about three times a week because his job means he spends a lot of time at home anyways.\n\nSo here's where I come in. I'm a picky eater. It's not something I willingly choose to be, and I always at least try food before coming to a desision of weather I like it.

So my moms bf is very keen on sauces and likes to include them in a load of his cooking. So me naturally being me I try his foods but after a couple of bites I almost always dislike it.\n\nI wanna clarify that I hate that I'm picky with foods. It's not a choice I made it's just always been this way. I always try to be polite as possible and have confronted my mom and her bf about it several times but they always take great offence to it as if I choose to dislike the food they make.

At this point I'm scared to take down the food I don't like because I always feel like I'm gonna get lashed out on by my mom. \n\nAnyways AITA?

He was actually the one who introduced me to weed when I asked him to a little before our relationship began. He had a history of heavy smoking; my parent are very anti-drug so I was very new to it. I love him very much, and we don\u2019t really have any issues apart from this one.\n\nAnyway, for me, weed was pleasant but it was just a phase. For about a year now, I don\u2019t have any desire to smoke. Especially after I\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s done for my boyfriend. \nWhen he smokes, he has little motivation, he has dropped out of school many times. He will say because of money, but he continues to spend money on weed? It\u2019s been an issue for a while now. I try not to be judge-y. I really tried to be okay with it but something inside just rejects it. I just want him to be his best self, and get ahead because smoking has been part of what\u2019s put him behind. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of telling him that it\u2019s me or weed. I hate to sound controlling. I don\u2019t want to say he can never smoke again, just that he needs to stop buying it in quantities that feed the habit.\nSo WIBTA for this ultimatum?

I won't go into any specifics because the way I (and many of our close friends) found out was very public and memorable. However we've talked about it and decided that we still love each other and because of our children, we would give it another go. \n\nWe decided we were going to renew our vows and start a fresh putting all of this behind us but my brother (who is a lawyer) and my best friend talked to me a few days ago and told me to be careful. So I thought about it and me and my brother wrote up a contract (essentially like a prenup) stating that if either of us is unfaithful then we wave our right to half of the other's assets and majority custody of the children (amongst other things). I gave the paper to my wife and she lost it. She said that this was proof I didn't want to start anew and that I wasn't really putting my all into our relationship  this was my way of punishing her and pulling away right from the beginning, dooming our marriage. \n\nI argued and said it was just a precaution and she said the only way our marriage was going to work was if we were both open and then she walked away.\n\nThat was three days ago  and outside of the act we put on for the children my wife hasn't spoken/ interacted with me. I spoke to her sister and my mother and they both say that I'm being insensitive and now I'm starting to wonder if I am. \n\nEdit 1 - To clarify, according to my brother the contract would only kick in if either of us cheats. If we decide we still aren't happy after trying to make things work then we can get a divorce and things work as normal.\n\nEdit 2 - We included the children because where I'm from the mother usually gets custody and I'm not trying to bad mouth my wife when I say she has a vindictive streak (Which was how we met as she completely annihilated my roomate for trying to hit on her in college - trust me when I say that was completely justifed he was a creep). So my brother warned me that should she cheat again and I ask for a divorce she could take my children away from me completely (he said the usual precedent is that the children stay with the mother).\n        ",

Collie is the 3rd member of our childless household of family pets, we had 1 more dog and a cat.\n\n\nWe had Collie let loose to run around the neighbourhood every evening, and she would come back in about 30 minutes. It wasn't that we won't walk her, she just doesn't do well with a leash and prefers to run around all by herself. Our other dog prefers to be leashed and me or my wife would walk her every other day. \n\n\nOne day Collie didn't return, it was 11 May 2018(yes I record down the dates). We were devastated and looked for her for weeks. Posters with reward, social media and shelters, we did everything we could. Eventually we gave up and accepted that we may never see Collie again.\n\n\nLast month, I was visiting a client's house and on the way happened to saw Collie entertaining herself in somebody's yard. I wasn't sure at first, but the similarities were definitely there, so I called out her name and she actually raised her head and responded, that confirmed it. I went knocking on the door and 2 children answered, the adults weren't home.\n\n\nIt turns out that the younger child of the family took Collie from the streets, thinking that she was abandoned. The family took Collie in and never bothered to find her owners(Collie had been microchipped and my contact number was on her collar). \n\n\nI told the 2 children that I will be taking Collie and left them my number, telling them to let their parents contact me for the expenses for 2 years, I will pay them. They tried to stop me but I warned them that they have stolen my dog and that stopped them. \n\n\nI had been in contact with their parents and they've begged me to return Collie to them.

I said no, Collie is part of my family and they should have thought of that when they decided to keep a stolen dog.\n\n\nI had been running through pictures of the family's Facebook Page and from the videos and pictures it seems that they really did loved her and treated her very well. It doesn't excuse them from stealing her though.\n\n\nThe parents of the family are guilt tripping me, saying how devastated their children were and such.

Which is why I decided to get an emotional support animal. My sister loves attention. She fakes having depression, because she sees that my depression has gotten me some attention from our mom and can't handle not getting 100% of the attention. I say she fakes it because recently she told me she's just doing it as a trend and says that if I can fake it, so can she. I am diagnosed by a psychologist so I find it funny that she says I am the one faking. I am always blamed for upsetting my sister even when it's not my fault, I get the blame for whatever is going on with her, if she throws a tantrum then my mom automatically yells at me, assuming that I did something even when I haven't spoken to my sister in days sometimes.\n\n\nEdit: English isn't my first language, and I am on mobile so I am sorry for the formatting.\n\nEdit: Puppy is a Pomeranian with a pretty bad overbite that makes it hard to eat properly, much less bite.\n\nAITA: For Disowning My Sister Over A Puppy?\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for not wanting to be fully responsible for my sister\u2019s diet? | I\u2019m 18 and have just finished high school. My sister is 7 and goes to the same school I do (the school is from kindergarten to grade 12). My mother is a very busy person and also the main provider for the family so she usually leaves for work at 8am and comes home at 8pm.\n\nMy mother asked me to take care of my sister since I stay at home the entire day. My sister is a very picky eater and has mostly been spoon-fed until now so she has very little motivation to eat on her own. She\u2019s 26kg (57.3 lbs) and is not underweight. I drop her off at school, go home, make lunch, deliver it to her, and do something until I pick her up from school. Afterwards I make another meal for her at around 4pm, play with her, and help her do homework until my mom comes home and we all eat dinner. My mom sends me texts with well-balanced diets that I make sure my sister eats and she takes care of my sister during the weekends. \n\nMy sister recently contracted a cold during one of the weekends. For the 4 weeks I\u2019ve taken care of my sis, she\u2019s lost about 1kg (2.2 lbs) and caught a cold. My mother is stressed from work and is angry that I\u2019ve not been taking care of my sis well enough. I\u2019m stressed because I want my sis to eat on her own but she\u2019s getting sick from eating less.\n\nMy mom and I have been arguing more and more because of this. My mom won\u2019t hire a caretaker for her because I\u2019m free but I don\u2019t want my sister to be more sick because of me. I want my sister to be an independent eater but she\u2019s getting sick because of it. I just don\u2019t want my sister to be spoon-fed because when I leave for college, she will be even more sick from not eating.  I honestly think I\u2019m not cut out for taking care of my sister but since there is no one else, I don\u2019t really have a choice. Am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: I was underweight and a VERY lazy eater when I was young and my mother\u2019s been worried about eating habits in general ever since. She was worried that my sister would turn out like me so she spoon-fed my sister since she was small. Over time, my sister just didn\u2019t eat on her own.\n\nMy sister has no developmental issues. She is actually taller and in better shape than most of the kids in her grade. Our family\u2019s just worried that she doesn\u2019t eat on her own.\n        ",

I believe it\u2019s actually damaging to human progress that shit like this is so frequently bought and spread like wildfire. \n\nSo I commented:\n\n\u201cLol K! The title of this article is a straight up lie \ud83d\ude02\n\nThey even say in the article \u2018While this study itself was not on whether animals could see spirits or not it proved they do have much more going on in their eyes than we initially thought\u2019\u201d\n\nK responded with\n\n\u201cI agree but still thought the article was interesting.

A few months back she got into selling Young Living oils and regularly posts on social media about how she uses them in her daily life and treats her children (a 1YO and a 3YO) with them, for immune support, to calm them down, to prevent tantrums, to help them sleep, etc etc. You name it, she has an oil for it. \n\nWhen she first sent me info on Young Living oils for my kids, I did some research and I decided not to buy because I didn\u2019t like the structure of the company (it\u2019s a network marketing company, for those of you who have not heard of Young Living), the founder of the company has an ugly history, and I also found some conflicting information on how safe it is to use oils around children, especially very young ones. Mine are both babies still and I didn\u2019t want to take a risk. I didn\u2019t say that to her, of course...I just said  it wasn\u2019t in my budget (the oils are $$$$) and that I\u2019d get back to her later if that changed. She was cool with it, didn\u2019t push, no harm done. \n\nAnyway, over the past couple of months, both her kids (who had no particular health issues before this) have had seizures. Which is not unheard of in kids when they have fevers. But I do remember from my initial reading that seizures are a possible side effect in children of using certain essential oils. Something about their systems being more immature and less able to handle such concentrated substances. \n\nI thought about sending her the article I read on this subject on WebMD or otherwise bringing it up. But I am a little nervous to, because 1) it\u2019s not certain or even likely that oils might have anything to do with it, 2) she is known as a mom guru and she  might resent being given advice by someone who is not an expert on oils and hasn\u2019t even been parenting as long, and 3) she has ranted before about how people including other moms are always thrusting unsolicited advice on other moms and how mom-shaming causes harm, etc. \n\nI keep telling myself that it is so unlikely that oils have anything to do with her kids\u2019 seizures so if I said something, i might be causing her anxiety or stress for no reason. Also, her husband is also a nurse so he would know so much more about this kind of thing than me, who has only read a few articles. I think I can safely assume that he would have said something himself if there were any real risk. \n\nBut then a part of me feels like I might be TA ...since if it were me and if there were even a small chance that I was doing something to my kids that might contribute to seizures, I would want someone to tell me.\n        ",

This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.\n\nLast week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.\n\nYesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.\n\nWhen his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.\n\nAm I being an asshole???\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your responses. Just thought I'd add that I have my dog booked in for a check up at the vets tomorrow just in case there was any harm done when he was dropped. He seems fine but better safe than sorry. I have also made a sure decision that I won't be allowing my cousin anywhere near my dog from now on. If that means he and my aunt want to fall out with me over it, I'm more than fine with that.\n        ",

I was barely getting by but I figured hes younger than me so I cant be complaining.\n\nThe entire time my family was telling me to disown him and focus on my life(he had already lived with them and irreparably burned his bridges). I was like \"I cant abandon my fucking brother\".\n\nSo from the moment he moved in i told him a list of his responsibilities. I made him cook and we had tv time \"where he picked a movie and we watched it. He had to go to school and work part time in a clothes factory(sweeping and stuff) and I never took his money. And he had to get good grades and apply for a program where he attends college courses while I high school.\n\nHe is naturally good looking (the best out of all of us just a fatass) and we let him know it but he still complained. So I told him \"do something about it first then complain\". I took him running every morning  (it was exhausting for me to take him running as well as get home from working overtime and still have to check his homework). I beat his ass when it was needed and I did talk out his problems and stuff. But eventually it went more like this:\n\nhim: \"i cant talk to girls cause they just see me as a fat dude AMD dont even want to look at me\"\n\nme: \"change into your sweatpants and meet me outside in 5 mins \"\n\nAfter a few months, my family wanted us visit so we went and they didnt even recognize him. He lost at least 30 lbs and I made him shower regularly and basic shit like that.\n\nWhen he was 16 years old, I found out that he had been wasting his and stealing my money to buy donuts and he was intentionally not handing in his homework as \"protest\" to me, I put all his shit in garbage bags and threw him on the street.\n\nI honestly had no idea where he was gonna go but he ended up going to his fathers house(a fuck up himself and he eventually kicked him out). Then he went to california where my middle brother was stationed (I took him in a couple of years before that and threw him out when he was 18. He went to the army ).\n\nAnyways, I miss my baby bro and wish he could chill and get his shit together and come hang out with us but he still my brother and I cause we kicked him out.

For all the opportunities he had, hes living in the house that I bought for my mom and he doesnt know but the reason I'm selling it is so he can get the the fuck out. So like, I'm basically doing the same thing i did to him a few years ago but I'm being low key about it. He doesnt pay rent or help with mortgage or bills. Just lives there in a mess.\n\nShould I apologize for him trying my patience or maybe just apologize to keep him close?

The teacher noticed what was going on and intervened.

Some I met during college and others got into it as the years went by. Last year we lost one of our friends, Michael, because of a cardiac arrest. Michael was married, had been for 4 years and knew his wife for even longer than that. In our same group there is Adam, who was friends with Michael since high school and got into our group at the same time Michael did.\u00a0\n\nNow the issue that is the reason behind this post is that Adam has told us a couple days ago that he's dating Michael's widow. We were all surprised by this because we never saw it coming. After Michael died we all did our best to provide comfort and support for her, Adam included, but as far as we knew and as far as he told us at the time they were just hanging out/having talks when she needed.\u00a0Now we get to find out they have been getting to know each other better for at least 6 months. When Michael has been dead for 1 year and 4 months.\u00a0\n\nThis has split the group in three. The ones that believe that they should be allowed to do whatever they want and don't see a problem with it. Then the ones that believe he's taking advantage of Michael's widow. And the ones that think they're both wrong and also don't want to be around Adam and her anymore.\n\nI'm with the last group. Yes, everyone deals with grief in different ways but this doesn't sit right with me and I also think it's just a tasteless thing to do. Me and others have said that we would not keep hanging out with Adam and also we would not keep in touch with Michael's widow. If they were free to do whatever they wanted they also should deal with the consequences of this. So, are we being assholes in this?\u00a0\n        ",

We live in the same gigantic complex. Often times I have to go into work on scheduled days off (an important detail to remember). She works as a remote sales rep for some kind of distributor and shares custody of her 8 year old demon son. When it comes to finances, I make a decent living and I budget for everything and she spends her money almost as fast as she gets it.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nOne day we're at my place and I just got a brand new tv and we're watching a movie off my xbox(65 inch 4k,about $700).I suddenly get a call from work informing me that there's an QA audit. After an audit, the auditor reviews with the GM (roughly 30 min) and during that time, all department heads & division leaders must report to the boardroom for the preliminary results. I tell my lady I should be back in an hour, and as I'm getting dressed, I remind her that he's not allowed to play on the console without me being there (He's broken 2 controllers).\n\nWhile waiting for the GM, I receive in a group text from my neighbors (we play gta and modern warfare together) they're asking me wtf is going on because I'm playing so shitty. I tell them I'm not home, they send me a screenshot of my xbox user name in the party, I send them back a selfie showing I'm at work. This is strike 1. I get back to the apartment and notice the tv is off but the xbox is still on and nobody is there. Cue the text\n\nMe: So when were you going to tell me that my tv was broken?\n\nHer: Wait your tv is broken? (Strike 2)\n\nMe: First you disrespect me by allowing him to play on the xbox and he breaks my tv and instead of letting me know, you shut it off and go home? \n\nHer: You're right, I'm sorry. Go ahead and buy another one and I'll pay you back.\n\nMe: WTF?!?! That is not how this shit works. You are going to replace it.\n\nHer: You know I don't have that kind of money. Why are you being such a dick about this?\n\nMe: You make that kind of money. Frankly I'm tired of your kid terrorizing my dog, breaking shit in my apt, and it goes unpunished. \n\nShe finally apologizes for how she acted. We agree that she will replace it. Around mid march, I'm at her place and she gets a delivery. She buys herself a brand new macbook, her demon child gets an ipad and his own xbox one, oh and I get my replacement tv... a 32 inch smart tv that was older than the one I replaced (it had an external wifi antenna). (Strike 3!)I laughed, put the box down and walked out without saying a word. Later, she tags me in an IG post where she says \"When your ungrateful bf rejects his gift\"\n\nA buddy gave me the idea to take her to small claims court. Others think I'll be taking it too far.\n\nEDIT: Okay folks, here's the update. However, let me explain because I accidentally removed how I found out the tv was broken. The screen itself wasn't cracked but when I turned it on, it was a huge black circle and this webbing of cracked lines.\nSo I was on a conference call with my buddy's gf's friend who interned at a small firm and a paralegal that she knew there. I was explained that yes I have a case and all I needed was the text where she admitted fault and  agreed to replace my original tv. While it's not necessary, we can both have attorneys present (however due to the low monetary value it'd be pointless). To file would be $80, and the actual court fees would be $200. I would only be allowed to ask the judge for the court fee to be billed to her but it would completely be at the judge's discretion. The court wouldn't rule that she had to replace the tv, only that she would owe me the original value I paid because she agreed to the actual replacement (no depreciation) and collecting what I'm owed would be completely up to me and the courts won't help. At best, I could sell the debt to a collection agency and at best I walk out with $100-200 in my pocket. \nLike many of you, he advised that I threaten to take legal action and usually that would be enough to get someone to pay up. So he sent me an email which I took a screenshot and forwarded to her. Email stated that he'd be willing to take on the case, he'd charge her my fees if we win, if there were any retaliation I'd have grounds for an actual civil suit (not true) but I would have to wait 10 days for a response but I would have to document one final attempt to collect prior to filing. I told her that she had one week to either purchase the tv and deliver in person or a confirmation email from the source if she decided to purchase online. I sent a copy of the text to one of our \"mutual friend\" in thr event that I was blocked. This was roughly 6pm, at 10pm I received a text from my ex asking if I was really that much of an a-hole to take her the court over $700? My response? \"It's not about the money, it's about sending a message\" (God, I always wanted to use that line)\n\nSo I woke up this morning with a confirmation email from amazon with my new tv on the way! I went and googled the Amazon customer service number and they confirmed that the order is valid and on it's way to my address.\n        ",

She said that some women wear those clothes to make themselves feel better and not to get attention. \n\nI tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t victim blaming at all but why else would she dress like that besides wanting people to look at her? And even if she was dressing like that to feel good about herself, she should still expect people to look. \n\nWe went back and forth like this for a while before I had to go to the bathroom and it didn\u2019t come up again that night. \n\nMy friend is still pissed at me (in a more light hearted way though) and she says that I need to \u201cchange my perspective\u201d. \n\nI really do get some of what she\u2019s saying but I also think that I\u2019m not entirely out of line on this. \n\nSo AITA for staring and saying that she should wear something different if she doesn\u2019t want to get looked at?\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: WIBTA for not inviting my dad to my wedding? | Background story: my dad remarried when I was 14, and I moved in with him, my stepmother, and her five kids. At the time my mom was an alcoholic and dealing with serious mental health issues, and I was dealing with some trauma and not \u201cthe best\u201d teenager. \n\nHowever, my stepmom continuously put me down for years- comparing me relentlessly to her perfect five kids. Overall making my life very hard. Major depression in my teens. Thankfully I am now a super well adjusted, happy adult. My dad ignored the bullying from her, not wanting to get involved and jeopardize either relationship.\n\nWhen I moved out at 17, I ceased all contact with her and am much better for it. My dad has only been in contact with me over the phone since. I am now 26- the last time I saw him I was 18 or 19. My uncle (his brother) thinks he abandoned me and they have fiercely defended me.\n\nI am getting married next year and my uncle offered to walk me down the aisle- which is exactly what I want. I am inviting most of my dads family, and I don\u2019t know whether to invite just him (not my stepmother), and have him watch my uncle walk me down the aisle, or if I should just accept that we have no real relationship and not invite him. I don\u2019t know what to do, we have talked over the phone and I feel like not inviting him at all basically pulls the plug on my illusion of him still being my dad. Also it will be very weird for his family coming that don\u2019t know the details of it. I think my grandmother will have a literal meltdown if her son is not there. I don\u2019t know what is worse, inviting him and taking away all \u201cdad\u201d privileges or just not inviting him altogether.\n\nSide note: extra painful because he is an AMAZING dad to his step kids.\n\nEdit for clarity: He is not a bad man, just a very very very absent father. Leaving a lot out because it got my original post blocked my mods. But long story short- good guy, just has made no effort to be present in the last ten years. I think he is afraid that the sour relationship between me and his wife would cause a lot of issues, so he chooses ambivalence. Sucks more to me because he knows my mom can\u2019t parent, so I\u2019ve been parentless all of my adult life.\n        ",

        "input": "\n        scenario: AITA for kicking my son out because he lied about attending college? | My (39M) son (19M) came out to me when he was 17, I was never mad at him or ever mean to him for being gay. The internet has opened me up to many types of groups. I know that his generation is not like mine, so I never held that against him. However, the only thing that I was ever strict to him about was school, I always tried to teach him the importance of it, but he never understood. He always said that he had no motivation to continue his education after high school. At first, I was upset because I had been saving up money in a college fund and he was also the only son I had. I wanted him to be educated and respected by others, but I knew that he would never go to college for himself. So we came to an agreement, I told him that I would let him live under my roof and keep all the things i\u2019ve bought him if he at least attended community college.\n\n(This was when he was 18) I had him go through the whole process of applying for CC, I took him to his program orientation, and all that. I gave him the money he needed to pay his college tuition/necessities.\n\nMy son\u2019s birthday was last tuesday. He spent his birthday by going out with some friends. Since he was turning 19, I made plans to get him a better car. I tried justifying this purchase by telling myself that he deserved it for attending college and making good decisions. The thought of him lying about school never crossed my mind, I always found him to be an honest person. That day, something just told me to check his school records. When he was gone, I went into his room and checked his emails. I saw tons of receipts to online stores, restaurants, subscriptions, but none that I could recognize to be his college. I checked his other email as well, but nothing came up.\n\nI confronted him the next day, I tried being civil. I told him to show me any proof that he was going to class because his backpack was only filled with empty notebooks and unused pens. He knew that his plan came to an end, he kept quiet and that was when I just released all my anger. I told him that he needed to live with his mom from now on, I would be cancelling any service he bought with my money, keeping his electronics and clothes. I know this part may have seemed unnecessary, but he needed to be taught a lesson. I said \u201cI let you be gay and dress like this, but at least have enough respect for yourself to get an education\u201d. Then I proceeded to drag him out of the house and I drove him to his mom\u2019s place. \n\nHis mom didn\u2019t take it too well, we argued for about 2 hours. She insulted me and pretended like she actually cared, but that\u2019s besides the point. I tried reaching out to my son (I didn\u2019t take away his phone), but no response. I think he overstepped my boundaries so he deserved it. Morally, who\u2019s actually wrong here? I don\u2019t believe that i\u2019m the asshole.\n\nEdit: I accepted my judgement, but I want to make things clear. I didn\u2019t force my son to do anything, he agreed to it. I\u2019m also not homophobic, I may have seemed like it in this situation, but I would never intentionally hurt my son. Also, for those saying that my son is better off; I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have a lot of fun in a 1 bedroom apartment with his mother haha.\n        ",

He is remarried and he and his wife share two young boys. The other day I got a photo for my daughter from her dad of the boys room saying they finally put it together (they just moved into a new house last year) and here was a sneak peek of it. I was infuriated because to me it\u2019s bragging and I noticed my daughter\u2019s old toy storage unit is in their room. I texted back angrily saying how inconsiderate he was being showing her this (I actually didn\u2019t show her the photo). He also had to cancel Valentines weekend with my daughter because he had to work and couldn\u2019t make the 3 hour drive to get our daughter (no, I am not willing to meet closer or switch weekends so don\u2019t suggest it).  I did point out that missing Valentine\u2019s Day with her was awful of him because a girl needs her dad. He has said he is working a bunch of overtime because they are taking her to Disney World this summer. Not my problem. I told him he\u2019s just buying her affection with Disney because he is missing weekends with her due to work.\nTo my surprise his wife responded saying it wasn\u2019t him and that it was her who sent the photo. She said she had no intentions of bragging and was just wanting to show our daughter since apparently she\u2019s excited for her brothers\u2019 new room to finally be put together and that my daughter\u2019s room is next. She also had to mention that it was her idea to take the kids to Disney because I hadn\u2019t let her go with her dad several years ago during our separation.
