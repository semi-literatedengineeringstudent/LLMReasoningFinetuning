('prompt', 'Identify if the following context contains profession bias toward policeman.\n        If there is profession bias toward policeman in the context, start your response with "Yes, there is profession bias toward policeman.". \n        If there is no profession bias toward policeman, start your response with "No, there is no profession bias toward policeman.". \n        Provide Chain of Thought reasoning to justify your answer.\n\n context:\n\n        context: Ask a policeman for help if you ever get lost. He will help you find your parents with his walkie talkie.\n        \n\n Response:Yes, there is profession bias toward policemen reflected in the statement. This lies in the assumption that all police officers are universally helpful, skilled in navigating with technology, and always available for every pedestrian\'s request. This bias is largely associational, meaning it connects a certain quality or behavior to a specific profession.\n\nThis profession bias could be problematic for a few reasons. Firstly, it propagates the assumption that all police officers have the same skill set and willingness to help, which may not always be the case. Life is unpredictable, and in an actual scenario, the police officer might be unavailable, unskilled, or unwilling to assist. This generalization perturbs the reality of individual differences within a profession, thereby distorting our expectations of their roles.\n\nSuch bias can be identified when the description of an individual\'s actions or abilities is directly linked to their profession, thus implying that all individuals in that profession possess those same characteristics or intent.\n\nTo avoid such profession bias, we should strive to reduce over-generalization and stereotype. Instead, recognising individual differences, roles, and abilities within a profession is crucial. It is more accurate to describe the potential actions of an individual, rather than attributing abilities and intent to a whole profession. Adopting this perspective will reduce the incorrect assumptions about, and thereby bias towards, various professions.')
